# Sealmetrics vs Google Analytics: Complete Comparison 2026

## Introduction: Why Businesses Are Switching from Google Analytics

Google Analytics has dominated web analytics for nearly two decades, but **2025 marks a turning point**. With cookie rejection rates reaching 87% in Germany and 73% across the EU, businesses using Google Analytics are losing 60-87% of their visitor data. This isn't a minor tracking gap—it's a business intelligence crisis.

Sealmetrics offers a fundamentally different approach: **cookieless analytics that captures 100% of visitor data without requiring consent banners**. Unlike Google Analytics, which relies on cookies and consent mechanisms that users increasingly reject, Sealmetrics uses session-based tracking under GDPR Article 6(1)(f) legitimate interest.

This comparison examines both platforms across privacy compliance, data accuracy, features, implementation, and cost. Whether you're evaluating Google Analytics alternatives or considering a migration, this guide provides the technical and legal details you need.

**Key Takeaways**:
- **Google Analytics loses 60-87% of EU traffic** from cookie rejections; Sealmetrics captures 100%
- **Google Analytics requires consent banners** under GDPR; Sealmetrics operates consentless under legitimate interest
- **Google Analytics stores IP addresses** (even when hashed); Sealmetrics never collects or stores IPs
- **Sealmetrics setup takes 2 minutes** with one script tag; Google Analytics requires 30-60 minutes of configuration

## Quick Comparison: Sealmetrics vs Google Analytics

| Aspect | Google Analytics 4 | Sealmetrics |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Primary Approach** | Cookie-based tracking | Cookieless session tracking |
| **Data Loss (EU)** | 60-87% | 0% |
| **Consent Required** | Yes (GDPR) | No |
| **IP Storage** | Yes (hashed) | Never stored |
| **Setup Time** | 30-60 minutes | 2 minutes |
| **GDPR Compliance** | Complex | Built-in |

---

## Cookie Requirements & Consent Mechanisms

### Google Analytics Cookie Approach

Google Analytics 4 relies on multiple cookies to track users:
- **_ga**: Main identifier (2 years)
- **_ga_&lt;container-id&gt;**: Session data (2 years)  
- **_gid**: User distinction (24 hours)
- **_gat**: Request throttling (1 minute)

These cookies fall under ePrivacy Directive Article 5(3), which requires explicit user consent before setting non-essential cookies. According to CNIL guidance from 2020, analytics cookies require consent unless they serve exclusively first-party purposes and don't enable user tracking across sites.

**The result**: In Germany, 87% of users reject cookie consent banners. In France, 73% reject. Across the EU, the average rejection rate is 60-65%. Every rejection means Google Analytics loses that visitor's data entirely.

### Sealmetrics Cookieless Approach

Sealmetrics doesn't use cookies at all. Instead, it generates temporary session identifiers stored in browser sessionStorage, which:
- Resets with each browsing session
- Never persists across sessions
- Doesn't enable cross-site tracking
- Falls under GDPR Article 6(1)(f) legitimate interest, not consent

Because Sealmetrics operates without cookies, it **doesn't trigger ePrivacy Directive consent requirements**. Businesses can track analytics data without consent banners, capturing 100% of visitor data while remaining GDPR compliant.

**Practical impact**: A German e-commerce site using Google Analytics sees analytics data for only 13% of visitors. The same site using Sealmetrics sees data for 100% of visitors—without changing its privacy approach.

---

## Data Capture Accuracy: The 60-87% Problem

### Google Analytics Data Loss

Google Analytics faces three major data loss vectors:

**1. Cookie Rejection (60-87% loss)**:
When users reject cookie banners, Google Analytics cannot track them at all. The visitor exists, browses, potentially converts—but leaves zero trace in your analytics.

**2. Ad Blocker Impact (25-40% additional loss)**:
Popular ad blockers like uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus, and Brave Browser block Google Analytics by default. Even users who accept cookies often have their Google Analytics tracking blocked at the browser level.

**3. Safari ITP & Firefox ETP**:
Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention restricts Google Analytics cookies to 7 days. Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection blocks Google Analytics entirely for many users. Combined Safari + Firefox market share: 30-35% of web traffic.

**Real-world example**: A German B2B SaaS company migrated from Google Analytics to Sealmetrics in September 2025. In their first week:
- Google Analytics: 3,247 sessions
- Sealmetrics: 24,982 sessions  
- **Data recovery: 7.7x more complete picture**

### Sealmetrics Data Capture

Sealmetrics captures 100% of visitors because:
- **No cookies = no cookie rejection**
- **Not blocked by ad blockers** (doesn't match tracking filter patterns)
- **Works across all browsers** including Safari, Firefox, Brave
- **No consent required** = tracking starts immediately

The technical approach uses:
1. **Session-ID**: Temporary identifier in sessionStorage
2. **Isolated Hits**: Each pageview tracked independently
3. **Server-side processing**: No client-side JavaScript dependencies that blockers target

Sealmetrics provides the complete visitor picture Google Analytics promises but can no longer deliver in privacy-conscious markets.

---

## GDPR Compliance Comparison

### Google Analytics Compliance Challenges

Google Analytics faces four major GDPR compliance issues:

**1. Consent Requirement (Article 6(1)(a))**:
CNIL confirmed in July 2020 that Google Analytics requires user consent because it uses cookies and enables cross-site tracking. This means:
- Consent banner mandatory
- Pre-checked boxes illegal
- Rejection must be as easy as acceptance
- Tracking prohibited until explicit consent

**2. IP Address Storage**:
Even when IP anonymization is enabled, Google Analytics still:
- Receives full IP addresses initially
- Hashes IP addresses (but hashing is considered pseudonymization, not anonymization)
- Stores hashed IPs for attribution across sessions
- GDPR Article 4(5) considers pseudonymized data as personal data

**3. Data Transfer to USA**:
After Schrems II invalidated Privacy Shield, transferring data to Google's US servers requires:
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
- Transfer Impact Assessment
- Potential data localization requirements
- Ongoing regulatory scrutiny

Austrian and French DPAs issued rulings in 2022 declaring Google Analytics non-compliant due to US data transfers.

**4. Data Retention Complexity**:
Google Analytics allows up to 14 months data retention without consent under CNIL guidance. Longer retention requires explicit consent and clear justification.

### Sealmetrics GDPR Compliance

Sealmetrics achieves GDPR compliance through technical design:

**1. Legitimate Interest Legal Basis (Article 6(1)(f))**:
Sealmetrics operates under legitimate interest because:
- No cookies used
- No cross-site tracking
- No personal data collection (zero IPs stored)
- Minimal data processed (sessions, pageviews, referrers)

CNIL's 2020 guidance explicitly allows audience measurement under legitimate interest when tools are:
- Limited to first-party measurement
- Don't enable cross-site tracking  
- Use privacy-preserving identifiers

Sealmetrics meets all three criteria.

**2. Zero IP Storage**:
Sealmetrics never collects or stores IP addresses—not even hashed. The system:
- Discards IP addresses at network layer
- Never logs IPs in any database
- Provides geolocation via CloudFlare headers (country-level only)
- Cannot correlate sessions via IP

**3. EU-Only Data Storage**:
All Sealmetrics data stays in EU servers:
- Primary: Germany (Hetzner)
- Backup: Netherlands
- No US data transfers
- No Schrems II concerns

**4. 25-Month Retention (No Consent)**:
Because Sealmetrics operates under legitimate interest and processes minimal data, it can retain analytics data for 24 months without consent—longer than Google Analytics' 14-month maximum under consent-free operation.

**Practical outcome**: Businesses using Sealmetrics don't need consent banners for analytics, passing DPO reviews without legal complexity Google Analytics introduces.

## When to Choose Google Analytics

Google Analytics 4 remains the better choice in specific scenarios:

**1. You Need Google Ads Integration**:
If your business relies heavily on Google Ads and needs detailed attribution, conversion import, and audience syncing, Google Analytics' native integration is unmatched. Sealmetrics doesn't integrate with Google Ads.

**2. You Need Advanced Predictive Metrics**:
Google Analytics 4's machine learning features (purchase probability, churn probability, predicted revenue) provide value for large e-commerce operations. Sealmetrics focuses on observed behavior, not predictions.

**3. You Operate Primarily Outside the EU**:
In markets where cookie rejection rates remain low (US: 20-30%, Asia: 10-20%), Google Analytics' data loss is less severe. However, ad blocker usage is global.

**4. You Have Existing GA Infrastructure**:
Large enterprises with years of Google Analytics data, custom dashboards, BigQuery integrations, and trained teams face high switching costs. Migration is disruptive even when beneficial.

**5. You Need Advanced Segmentation**:
Google Analytics 4's user properties, audience builder, and cross-device tracking provide sophisticated segmentation. Sealmetrics offers basic filtering but not GA4's depth.

---

## When to Choose Sealmetrics

Sealmetrics is the better choice when:

**1. You Operate in Privacy-Conscious Markets**:
If your primary traffic comes from the EU (especially Germany, France, Netherlands), Sealmetrics captures 5-8x more data than Google Analytics. This isn't a minor improvement—it's the difference between seeing 15% vs 100% of your visitors.

**2. You Need GDPR Compliance Without Consent Banners**:
Businesses that want analytics without the UX friction of consent banners, the legal complexity of consent management, or the data loss from rejections should use Sealmetrics. It's GDPR-compliant by design, not by configuration.

**3. You Value Setup Simplicity**:
If you're a startup, small business, or lean team without dedicated analytics engineers, Sealmetrics' 2-minute setup vs Google Analytics' hours of configuration is transformative.

**4. You Don't Need Google Ads Attribution**:
For B2B companies, content sites, SaaS products, or any business not heavily reliant on Google Ads, Sealmetrics provides everything needed without Google Analytics' complexity.

**5. You Want Predictable Costs**:
Sealmetrics' transparent pricing—99 EUR/month for 1M pageviews with no hidden costs—is easier to budget than Google Analytics' "free" product with $10,000+ in associated costs.

**6. You Can't Pass DPO Review with Google Analytics**:
Many Data Protection Officers reject Google Analytics due to Schrems II, IP storage, or consent complexity. Sealmetrics passes DPO review because it's designed for legitimate interest operation under GDPR Article 6(1)(f).

## Migration Guide: Google Analytics to Sealmetrics

### Step 1: Audit Current Google Analytics Setup

**Document**:
- Key metrics you track (sessions, pageviews, conversions)
- Custom events configured
- E-commerce tracking setup
- Integration points (Google Ads, other tools)
- Dashboard/report requirements
- Team members who need access

**Identify what you'll lose**:
- Google Ads attribution
- Predictive metrics  
- Historical data (Sealmetrics doesn't import GA history)
- Advanced segmentation

**Decide migration approach**:
- **Parallel running**: Keep Google Analytics alongside Sealmetrics for 30-60 days to compare
- **Hard cutover**: Replace Google Analytics immediately

### Step 2: Set Up Sealmetrics

**Account creation** (2 minutes):
1. Sign up at sealmetrics.com
2. Add your domain
3. Copy script tag

**Installation** (2 minutes):
1. Add script tag to `<head>` section on all pages
2. If using Google Tag Manager:
   - Create new Custom HTML tag
   - Paste Sealmetrics script
   - Set trigger: All Pages
   - Publish container

**Verification** (1 minute):
1. Visit your website
2. Check Sealmetrics dashboard
3. Confirm pageview appears in real-time

Total setup time: 5 minutes.

### Step 3: Configure Custom Events (Optional)

Sealmetrics tracks pageviews automatically. For custom events:

**Example: Track button clicks**:
```javascript
<button onclick="sealmetrics('trackEvent', 'Button Click', {label: 'CTA'})">
  Click Me
</button>
```

**Example: Track e-commerce purchases**:
```javascript
sealmetrics('trackEvent', 'Purchase', {
  value: 99.00,
  currency: 'EUR',
  orderId: '12345'
});
```

### Step 4: Remove or Modify Consent Banner

**If running only Sealmetrics**:
- Remove Google Analytics from consent banner configuration
- May be able to remove consent banner entirely (consult legal)
- Update privacy policy to mention Sealmetrics

**If running parallel (Google Analytics + Sealmetrics)**:
- Keep consent banner for Google Analytics
- Don't gate Sealmetrics behind consent (it doesn't require it)
- Sealmetrics captures 100% even when users reject Google Analytics

### Step 5: Parallel Running Period (Recommended)

**For 30-60 days**:
- Run both Google Analytics and Sealmetrics
- Compare key metrics weekly
- Expect Sealmetrics to show 5-8x more sessions in EU markets
- This isn't a discrepancy—it's the true traffic Google Analytics misses

**What you'll see**:
```
Week 1 Comparison (German e-commerce site):
- Google Analytics: 4,231 sessions
- Sealmetrics: 28,947 sessions
- Difference: 6.8x more complete data

Cookie rejection rate: 84%
Sealmetrics captured: 100% of visitors
Google Analytics captured: 16% of visitors
```

### Step 6: Cut Over to Sealmetrics Only

**After parallel period**:
1. Remove Google Analytics tracking code
2. Remove Google Analytics from consent banner
3. Simplify or remove consent banner if Sealmetrics is only tracking tool
4. Update privacy policy
5. Export any critical historical Google Analytics data
6. Archive Google Analytics property (don't delete—keep for historical reference)

**Team transition**:
- Sealmetrics dashboard is simpler than GA4 (by design)
- Most teams adapt in 1-2 days vs weeks for GA4
- Basic metrics are prominently displayed
- No need for extensive training

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Sealmetrics truly GDPR compliant without consent?

Yes. Sealmetrics operates under GDPR Article 6(1)(f) legitimate interest because it:
- Doesn't use cookies
- Doesn't enable cross-site tracking
- Doesn't collect IP addresses
- Processes minimal data for first-party analytics only

CNIL's July 2020 guidance explicitly allows audience measurement tools to operate under legitimate interest when they meet these criteria. Sealmetrics was designed specifically to meet this legal framework.

### Why doesn't Sealmetrics show up in ad blocker lists?

Ad blockers primarily target tools that:
- Track users across multiple sites
- Serve advertisements
- Build user profiles
- Use common tracking domains (google-analytics.com, facebook.net)

Sealmetrics:
- Only tracks first-party (your own website)
- Doesn't serve ads
- Doesn't build profiles
- Uses unique domain per customer (app.sealmetrics.com)

As a result, Sealmetrics doesn't match the patterns ad blockers target. It's not about "evading" blockers—it's about providing legitimate first-party analytics that privacy tools have no reason to block.

### How accurate is Sealmetrics compared to Google Analytics?

**In non-EU markets with low cookie rejection**: Both tools show similar numbers (plus or minus 5% variance).

**In EU markets with high cookie rejection**: Sealmetrics captures 5-8x more data because it tracks visitors who reject cookies. This isn't Sealmetrics being "more accurate"—it's Sealmetrics seeing the visitors Google Analytics misses.

**Example (French SaaS company, October 2025)**:
- Google Analytics: 12,483 sessions
- Sealmetrics: 73,291 sessions
- Google Search Console: 71,428 clicks

Sealmetrics matched Google Search Console (ground truth) within 2.5%. Google Analytics showed only 17% of actual traffic.

### Can I use Sealmetrics and Google Analytics together?

Yes, many businesses run both during a transition period:
- **Sealmetrics** captures all visitors (100%)
- **Google Analytics** captures consented visitors (15-40% in EU)
- Gives you both complete data (Sealmetrics) and Google Ads integration (Google Analytics)

However, you'll still need a consent banner for Google Analytics, reducing the UX benefits of Sealmetrics. Most businesses choose one tool once they see Sealmetrics captures the full picture.

### Does Sealmetrics work with Google Tag Manager?

Yes. Add Sealmetrics via a Custom HTML tag in Google Tag Manager:

1. Create new Custom HTML tag
2. Paste Sealmetrics script
3. Trigger: All Pages
4. Publish

However, direct implementation (script tag in `<head>`) is simpler and loads faster. Google Tag Manager adds unnecessary complexity for a single analytics script.

### What happens to my Google Analytics historical data?

Sealmetrics doesn't import historical data from Google Analytics. Your options:

1. **Keep Google Analytics archived**: Maintain access to historical data for reference
2. **Export critical data**: Use Google Analytics Data API or BigQuery export to save key reports
3. **Accept fresh start**: Many businesses find clean historical data less valuable than complete current data

Most businesses choose option 1—keep Google Analytics read-only for historical reference while using Sealmetrics for all new tracking.

### How does Sealmetrics handle bot traffic?

Sealmetrics filters known bots and crawlers:
- Google Bot, Bing Bot (identified via user agent)
- Scrapers, monitoring tools
- Datacenter IPs

However, sophisticated bots that mimic real browsers may pass through. This is true for all analytics tools, including Google Analytics. The impact is typically less than 2% of traffic.

### Can I track subdomains with Sealmetrics?

Yes. Sealmetrics can track multiple subdomains under one configuration:
- `example.com`
- `blog.example.com`
- `app.example.com`

Sessions continue across subdomains, providing unified visitor tracking. This works because Sealmetrics uses sessionStorage (which is origin-bound) rather than cookies (which have complex domain scoping).

### Does Sealmetrics support A/B testing tools?

Yes, Sealmetrics works alongside A/B testing tools like:
- Optimizely
- VWO
- Google Optimize (deprecated but still in use)
- Custom solutions

Sealmetrics tracks the pageviews and conversions; your A/B testing tool handles variant assignment. They operate independently.

### What's Sealmetrics' data retention policy?

Sealmetrics retains analytics data for **24 months** without requiring user consent. This is longer than Google Analytics' 14-month maximum under consent-free operation.

After 24 months, data is automatically deleted. You can export data before deletion if needed for long-term archival.

### How does Sealmetrics pricing scale?

Sealmetrics pricing is volume-based on monthly events:
- 1M events: 229 EUR/month (Starter)
- 5M events: 459 EUR/month (Growth)
- 25M events: 919 EUR/month (Scale)
- 100M events: 1,724 EUR/month (Pro)
- Unlimited: Custom pricing (Enterprise)

Annual billing saves approximately 15%. All plans include unlimited websites and unlimited users.

**Overages**: If you exceed your plan's event limit, tracking continues without interruption. Overage is billed per 100,000 additional events at your plan's overage rate.

### Can I self-host Sealmetrics?

No. Sealmetrics is cloud-only, hosted on EU servers (Germany primary, Netherlands backup). Self-hosting isn't offered because:

1. **Compliance burden**: Self-hosting transfers GDPR controller responsibilities to you
2. **Maintenance costs**: Infrastructure, updates, security patches
3. **Pricing model**: Cloud-only enables simple, affordable pricing

If your organization requires self-hosted analytics, consider Matomo (which offers self-hosted option but requires more technical expertise).

## Conclusion: Complete Data vs Compliant Data

The choice between Google Analytics and Sealmetrics isn't about features—it's about **whether you want to see 15% or 100% of your visitors**.

Google Analytics dominated when cookies were accepted by default. In 2054, with 60-87% cookie rejection rates across the EU and rising ad blocker usage globally, Google Analytics shows an increasingly incomplete picture.

**Sealmetrics solves the fundamental problem**: How do you track website analytics in a privacy-first world where users reject cookies and block trackers?

The answer: Don't use cookies. Don't require consent. Capture 100% of visitors through session-based tracking under legitimate interest.

**For businesses operating in the EU**, the data completeness difference is decisive:
- German site: 87% rejection rate = Google Analytics sees 13% of visitors
- French site: 73% rejection rate = Google Analytics sees 27% of visitors
- Same sites with Sealmetrics: 100% visibility, zero data loss

**For businesses prioritizing simplicity**, the setup difference is transformative:
- Google Analytics: 30-60 minutes + consent banner integration + legal review
- Sealmetrics: 2 minutes, one script tag, no configuration

**For businesses that want GDPR compliance without friction**, Sealmetrics provides the legal framework Google Analytics requires but can't deliver without consent:
- No cookies = No consent requirement
- No IPs stored = No personal data concerns  
- EU-only servers = No Schrems II issues
- Legitimate interest = No consent management complexity

**The trade-off**: You give up Google Ads attribution, predictive metrics, and advanced segmentation. But you gain complete visibility into visitor behavior—the foundation all other analytics builds on.
