# Real Time Tracking Consent

**Marketers love real-time dashboards.** Seeing how many people are on your site “right now” is exciting. But in Europe, the law is strict: **not all “real-time tracking” is legal without consent.**

[Access to Real Time Tracking Consent Guide](https://resources.sealmetrics.com/real-time-analytics-guide.html)

In this article, we break down what the **CNIL (France)** and the **AEPD (Spain)** actually say, why reports like “last 30 minutes” may put you at legal risk, and how Sealmetrics solves this by design.

## **Why consentless analytics matters**

Consent banners are killing data. In Spain and France, brands lose **30–60% of visits and conversions** when users reject cookies.

Both CNIL and AEPD allow **audience measurement without consent**, but only if the tool meets strict conditions:

- No cross-site tracking.

- IP anonymization.

- Data retention limits.

- **Aggregated, anonymous statistics.**

👉 The critical detail: **AEPD requires data to be “aggregated daily”** (except page load, which can be hourly).

## **Real-time vs. daily aggregation: the difference that matters**

**Allowed without consent:**

- *“Today you’ve had 500 pageviews.”*

- *“Right now there are 33 users on the site.”*

- These are **snapshots or daily accumulations**, not logs of individuals.

  **Not allowed without consent:**

- *“Last 30 minutes: 20 visits.”*

- *Visitor log: this user saw A, then B, then C.*

- These are **sub-daily buckets** or individual journeys → **need consent** under AEPD.



**Snapshot vs. Window:**

- *Snapshot (33 users now)* → ephemeral, aggregated, safe.

- *Window (last 30 min)* → stored sub-daily aggregation, not exonerated → needs consent.

## **What CNIL and AEPD actually say**

- **CNIL (France)**: Focuses on anonymity and no profiling. Real-time snapshots are fine if data is aggregated.

- **AEPD (Spain)**: Explicitly requires **daily aggregation** for audience metrics, with one exception (page load times by hour).

## **How tools handle this**

### **Why Sealmetrics is different**

Sealmetrics was built from the ground up to comply with **both CNIL and AEPD**:

- **Real-time data, but always aggregated daily.**

- **No cookies, no fingerprinting, no sub-daily windows.**

- **No visitor logs.**

- **EU hosting and contracts as data processor.**

This means: you can see your traffic “today so far” in real time, but you’ll never risk exposing an individual user’s navigation.

## **Bottom line**

- **Real-time ≠ illegal.** You can show snapshots or today’s totals without consent.

- **Sub-daily windows (30 min, hourly, logs) = not exonerated.** Require consent under AEPD.

- **Sealmetrics** is the only platform designed to give marketers **real-time visibility and 100% compliance** with both CNIL and AEPD.

🔒 *Sealmetrics: Real-time insights. Always aggregated. Always compliant.*
