**The Bottom Line**: Both are vast improvements over Google Analytics. Plausible is a solid cookieless analytics tool with good privacy practices. **Sealmetrics** goes further by eliminating IP storage entirely, achieving true consentless operation, and capturing 100% of visitor data without legal risk.

## Background: Understanding Both Tools

### What is Plausible Analytics?

**Plausible Analytics** launched in 2019 as an open-source, privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. Founded by Uku Täht and Marko Saric, Plausible quickly gained popularity in the privacy-conscious developer community.

**Key characteristics**:
- Open-source (AGPL license)
- Self-hosted or cloud-hosted options
- Lightweight script (less 1KB)
- No cookies by default
- European-owned (Estonia-based)
- Simple, minimalist dashboard

**Market position**: Plausible has become one of the most popular Google Analytics alternatives, with 10,000+ paying customers and strong adoption among developers, indie hackers, and small businesses prioritizing privacy.

### What is Sealmetrics?

**Sealmetrics** launched in 2023 specifically to solve the "consent paradox" in web analytics—the fact that cookie-based and consent-based analytics lose 60-87% of data in EU markets. Founded by privacy and analytics experts, Sealmetrics pioneered "consentless analytics" operating under GDPR legitimate interest.

**Key characteristics**:
- Proprietary (closed-source)
- Cloud-hosted only
- Dual tracking system (Session-ID + Isolated Hits)
- Zero IP storage architecture
- Spanish company (GDPR-native)
- Focus on EU compliance and 100% data capture

**Market position**: Sealmetrics is positioned as the most privacy-compliant cookieless analytics platform, specifically designed for EU businesses that cannot afford data loss from cookie/consent rejection.

## Technical Architecture Comparison

The fundamental technical differences between Plausible and **Sealmetrics** determine their privacy characteristics, compliance profiles, and data accuracy.

### Session Tracking Methods

**Plausible's Approach**:
```javascript
// Simplified Plausible session identification
const sessionId = hash(
  ipAddress +          // User's IP (hashed with daily salt)
  userAgent +          // Browser identifier
  domain               // Website domain
);
// Stored in database: sessionId (derived from hashed IP)
```

Plausible uses a **hashed IP address** combined with user agent and domain to generate a session identifier. The hash uses a daily rotating salt, meaning the same user gets a different session ID each day.

**Pros**:
- Reasonably privacy-preserving (hashing adds protection)
- Simple implementation
- Works across different privacy settings

**Cons**:
- Hashed IPs are still considered personal data under GDPR
- Some legal experts argue this requires consent
- Lack of  KPIs for professional porpouse

**Sealmetrics' Approach**:

**Sealmetrics** uses proprietary cookieless technology to identify sessions without storing IP addresses or personal data. Critically, **IP addresses are never stored**—they're used only for one-time geolocation lookup, then immediately discarded from memory.

**Pros**:
- No IP storage = not personal data under GDPR
- True consentless operation under legitimate interest
- Cannot be used to identify individuals

**Cons**:
- Less number of clients and community.
- It's not as easy to use than Plausible.

### IP Address Handling

This is the most critical technical difference.

**Plausible**:
```
1. Receive request with IP address
2. Hash IP with daily rotating salt
3. Store hashed IP in database
4. Use hashed IP for session identification
5. Hashed IP retained for duration of data retention
```

**GDPR Consideration**: The European Data Protection Board has stated that hashed IP addresses are still personal data if they can be used to identify individuals—especially when combined with other data (user agent, timestamps, etc.).

**Sealmetrics**:
```
1. Receive request with IP address
2. Check if the IP is one of Sealmetrics's Bot-IPs list.
3. Block the IP otherwise is a human user.
4. Sealmetrics doesn't know the IP of the user.
```

**GDPR Consideration**: By never storing IPs (even hashed), **Sealmetrics** avoids processing personal data entirely. This allows operation under GDPR Article 6(1)(f) legitimate interest without consent requirements.


## Privacy & GDPR Compliance Comparison

### Consent Requirements

**Plausible's Position**:

Plausible states that their tool "does not require cookie consent" under most circumstances. However, the reality is more nuanced:

- **GDPR Article 6(1)(f)**: Plausible claims legitimate interest basis
- **IP Hashing**: Some DPOs argue hashed IPs require consent under strict GDPR interpretation
- **Configuration-Dependent**: Whether consent is needed depends on how you configure Plausible

From Plausible's own documentation:
> "In most cases, Plausible Analytics does not require cookie consent. However, depending on your specific use case and interpretation by your Data Protection Officer, consent might still be necessary."

**Translation**: Plausible shifts legal risk to the user. Your DPO may require a consent banner despite using Plausible.

**Sealmetrics' Position**:

**Sealmetrics** is unambiguous: **no consent required, ever**. This is possible because:

1. **No personal data processing**: Zero IP storage means no personal data under GDPR
2. **GDPR Article 6(1)(f)**: Documented legitimate interest for website analytics
3. **Purpose limitation**: Data used exclusively for analytics, never advertising
4. **Data minimization**: Only aggregated, non-personal data collected
5. **CNIL guidance compliance**: Meets French regulator's requirements for consentless analytics
6. **AEPD guidance compliance**: Meets Spanish regulator's requirements for consentless analytics

Multiple DPOs in Germany, France, and Spain have approved **Sealmetrics** implementations without consent banners. The legal basis is clear and documented.

### CNIL Compliance (France)

The CNIL (French data protection authority) issued specific guidance on analytics in 2020, updated in 2024:

**Requirements for consentless analytics**:
1. No cookies stored on user device
2. No cross-site tracking
3. No IP address storage for user identification
4. Limited data retention (≤24 months)
5. Clear privacy policy disclosure

**Plausible**:
- ✅ No cookies
- ✅ No cross-site tracking
- ⚠️ Stores hashed IPs (questionable compliance)
- ✅ Configurable retention
- ✅ Privacy policy possible

**Verdict**: Plausible's IP hashing creates gray area under CNIL guidance.

**Sealmetrics**:
- ✅ No cookies
- ✅ No cross-site tracking
- ✅ Zero IP storage
- ✅ 24-month retention (CNIL-optimized)
- ✅ Privacy policy included

**Verdict**: **Sealmetrics** fully complies with CNIL requirements explicitly.

### TTDSG Compliance (Germany)

Germany's TTDSG (Telecommunications-Telemedia Data Protection Act) is among Europe's strictest privacy laws.

**Key requirement**: Consent is required for storing/accessing information on user devices (§25 TTDSG).

**Plausible**:
- ✅ No cookies stored (TTDSG compliant)
- ⚠️ Hashed IP question remains (under German interpretation)

**Sealmetrics**:
- ✅ No cookies stored
- ✅ No IP storage
- ✅ Fully TTDSG compliant

German DPOs have been particularly strict about hashed IP addresses. **Sealmetrics'** zero-IP approach eliminates this concern entirely.

## Data Accuracy & Loss Comparison

This is where the technical differences translate to business impact.


### Session Tracking Accuracy

**Plausible** (daily rotating hash):
```
Day 1: User visits, session_id = hash(IP + UA + "2024-11-25")
Day 2: Same user returns, session_id = hash(IP + UA + "2024-11-26")
Result: Counted as 2 unique users, not returning visitor
```

**Limitation**: Daily rotation means multi-day visitor journeys are broken. A user visiting Monday and Tuesday appears as two separate users.

**Sealmetrics** (no tracking session):
```
Day 1: User visits, new session generated (no cookies, no personal data)
Session expires after users leave the website
Day 2: Same user returns, new session generated
Result: Properly tracked as new visitor
```

### From Plausible to Sealmetrics

**Why migrate**: If you discover:
- Your DPO requires consent banner even with Plausible
- Data loss is higher than expected (20-30% in EU)
- You need conversion funnels
- Multi-day attribution is critical

**Migration Process**:

**Step 1: Add Sealmetrics** (keep Plausible running)
```html
<!-- Keep Plausible temporarily -->
<script defer data-domain="yourdomain.com" src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"></script>

<!-- Add Sealmetrics -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.sealmetrics.com/sl.js"></script>
```

**Step 2: Compare Data** (14 days minimum)
- **Sealmetrics** should show 20-30% more traffic (the data Plausible loses)
- Verify geographic accuracy
- Test conversion tracking
- Check API integration if needed

**Step 3: Remove Plausible**
- Remove Plausible script
- Cancel subscription (keep one month as backup)
- Update privacy policy to mention **Sealmetrics**

**Step 4: Remove Consent Banner** (if present)
If you had consent banner with Plausible:
- Remove banner code completely
- Update privacy policy to explain consentless basis
- Notify users via blog post (optional but transparent)

**Historical Data**: Cannot migrate between platforms. Export key reports from Plausible before canceling.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use both Plausible and Sealmetrics together?

Yes, but it's generally unnecessary. Both tools serve the same purpose (cookieless analytics). Running both:
- Increases page weight minimally (~9KB total)
- Provides redundancy if one service has issues
- Allows comparison during migration

**Recommendation**: Use both during 30-day migration, then choose one.

### Is Plausible's open-source model better for privacy?

**Transparency**: Yes, open source allows code auditing
**Privacy**: Not necessarily—both tools are privacy-first by design

**Sealmetrics'** closed-source approach doesn't inherently mean less privacy. The documented zero-IP architecture is verifiable through:
- Network traffic inspection (no IPs sent to servers)
- GDPR compliance documentation
- Third-party audits (available on request)

**Verdict**: Open source offers transparency advantage, but both tools achieve similar privacy outcomes.

### Does Plausible require consent in Germany?

**Legal answer**: It depends on interpretation.

**Conservative DPOs** (30-40%): Argue hashed IPs are personal data → require consent
**Moderate DPOs** (40-50%): Accept hashed IPs under legitimate interest → no consent
**Liberal DPOs** (10-20%): Accept any cookieless approach → no consent

**Sealmetrics** eliminates this ambiguity: zero IP storage means clearly no consent needed under any interpretation.

### Can Sealmetrics track authenticated users across devices?

No. **Sealmetrics** (and Plausible) are designed specifically NOT to track individuals across devices or sessions. This is a privacy feature, not a limitation.

For authenticated user analytics (post-login behavior), consider:
- Server-side analytics (log user_id with pageviews)
- Combine **Sealmetrics** with application analytics (e.g., Mixpanel for logged-in users)

### What about ad blockers—do they block either tool?

**Ad blockers** (uBlock Origin, etc.):
- **Plausible**: Blocked by ~5-10% of users (occasionally caught in filter lists)
- **Sealmetrics**: Blocked by ~3-5% of users

Both are significantly better than Google Analytics (~35% blocked). Neither tool is "advertising," so most blockers allow them.

**Workaround**: Both support custom domain (CNAME) setup to bypass even aggressive blockers.

### Can I migrate from Plausible to Sealmetrics without losing data?

**Historical data**: Cannot be migrated directly due to different data structures.

**Process**:
1. Export key reports from Plausible (CSV)
2. Implement **Sealmetrics** alongside Plausible
3. Run parallel for 30 days (overlap data for comparison)
4. Remove Plausible once confident
5. Refer to exported Plausible data for historical comparisons

### Which tool has better performance (page load impact)?

**Plausible**:
- Script size: 1.3 KB (gzipped)
- Load time: ~20-30ms
- Performance impact: Negligible

**Sealmetrics**:
- Script size: 1.3 KB (gzipped)
- Load time: ~20-30ms
- Performance impact: Negligible

**Verdict**: Both have virtually identical script sizes and minimal impact. The difference is imperceptible to users.

### Does either tool work with Cloudflare?

**Both** work perfectly with Cloudflare:
- Cloudflare doesn't interfere with either script
- Both can use Cloudflare for script delivery (custom domain)
- Cloudflare's privacy features don't conflict with either tool

### Can I white-label either tool for my agency?

**Plausible**:
- ✅ Yes via self-hosting
- You can rebrand completely
- Requires technical setup

**Sealmetrics**:
- ❌ White-label not available
- Managed service (no self-hosting)

### Which has better support?
