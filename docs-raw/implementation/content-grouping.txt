# Content Grouping

Content Grouping lets you tag pages with a label (e.g., "blog", "products", "checkout") so you can analyze performance by section rather than individual URLs.

## Setting up content grouping

### Option 1: Default group via script tag

Add the `group` parameter to your tracker script URL to set a default content group for all pages using that script:

```html
<script src="https://t.sealmetrics.com/t.js?id=your-site-id&group=blog" defer></script>
```

This is useful when different sections of your site use different templates (e.g., your blog template always includes `group=blog`).

### Option 2: Per-page override in JavaScript

Override the content group dynamically when tracking a pageview:

```javascript
sealmetrics({ group: 'product-category' });
```

This takes priority over the default group set in the script URL.

## Viewing content group reports

Content grouping data appears in the **Pages** report:

1. Go to your site dashboard
2. Click on **Pages**
3. Use the content group filter to see metrics by group
4. Each page shows its content group badge

### Metrics available per group

- Page views
- Entrances
- Average time on page
- Bounce rate

## Landing pages by content group

The **Landing Pages** report also supports content grouping. Filter by content group to see which sections of your site attract the most new visitors.

## API usage

Filter by content group in API requests:

```
GET /api/v1/stats/pages?account_id=my-site&period=30d&content_grouping=blog
```

Get a list of all content groups with metrics:

```
GET /api/v1/stats/pages/content-groups?account_id=my-site&period=30d
```

## Default value

Pages without a content group are labeled `(not set)`.
