## Status Codes

- **200 OK** – The request was successful  
- **400 Bad Request** – The request was invalid or cannot be served  
- **401 Unauthorized** – Authentication is required or has failed  
- **403 Forbidden** – The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it  
- **404 Not Found** – The requested resource could not be found  
- **429 Too Many Requests** – Rate limit exceeded  
- **500 Internal Server Error** – An error occurred on the server

## Rate Limits

Sealmetrics API rate limits vary depending on your plan:

- **Starter Plan**: 0 requests per minute  
- **Growth Plan**: 1 request per day  
- **Enterprise Plan**: 1 request per minute  

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a **429 Too Many Requests** response.  
Implement retry logic using *exponential backoff* to avoid repeated failures.
