# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common API errors, how to debug them, and where to get help.

---

## Common Errors

### Authentication Errors

**401 Unauthorized**  
Your authentication token is invalid or has expired.  
**Solution:** Request a new token using the Login endpoint.

**"Invalid credentials"**  
The email or password sent to the Login endpoint is incorrect.  
**Solution:** Verify your credentials and try again.

---

## Request Errors

**400 Bad Request**  
Your request parameters are missing or incorrectly formatted.  
**Solution:** Check the error message to identify which parameter is incorrect.

**404 Not Found**  
The endpoint URL is invalid.  
**Solution:** Confirm the endpoint matches the documentation exactly.

**429 Too Many Requests**  
You exceeded the allowed request rate.  
**Solution:** Implement exponential backoff and retry logic.

## Response Parsing Errors

**JSON Decode Error**  
Occurs when the response is not valid JSON.  
**Solution:** Inspect the raw response — the API may have returned an HTML error or plain-text message.

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable verbose logging** to capture full request and response data.
2. **Check all required headers**, especially Authorization and Content-Type.
3. **Validate all parameters** before sending the request.
4. **Test endpoints with cURL** to confirm whether issues come from your code or the API.
5. **Monitor token expiration** and refresh tokens as needed.
