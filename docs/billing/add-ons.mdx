## Add-on vs Upgrade

### When to Use Add-ons

Add-ons are best when:
- You need one specific thing (more accounts, more pageviews)
- Your needs are temporary (seasonal traffic)
- Upgrading would include features you don't need

### When to Upgrade

Upgrading is better when:
- You need multiple features from the higher tier
- Add-on costs approach the upgrade cost
- You want included features (SSO, dedicated support)

**Cost comparison example:**

```
Current: Research (€199/month)
Need: 3 accounts + 1M extra pageviews

Option A: Add-ons
  Research plan:        €199
  Account Pack (5):      €75  (prorated for 3)
  1M Pageviews:          €90
  Total:                €364/month

Option B: Upgrade to Guard
  Guard plan:           €399/month
  Includes: 3 accounts, 2M pageviews, more features

Recommendation: Upgrade to Guard
  - Only €35 more
  - Get 60+ anomaly rules
  - Get BigQuery integration
  - Get real-time alerts
```

## Question Pack Details

### How Question Packs Work

1. **Purchase:** Buy a pack (100, 250, or 500 questions)
2. **Add to balance:** Questions add to your available balance
3. **Use:** Questions deduct from pack first, then plan allowance
4. **Rollover:** Unused pack questions never expire

### Usage Order

```
Monthly allowance: 200 questions (Guard plan)
Question pack: 100 questions purchased

When you ask a question:
1. First uses pack questions (100 → 99)
2. Then uses monthly allowance (200 → 199)
3. Then charges overage (€0.40/question)

At month end:
- Pack questions: Remaining roll over
- Monthly allowance: Resets to 200
```

### Checking Balance

Go to **LENS → Settings → Usage**:

```
LENS Questions Balance
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Monthly allowance:    127 / 200 remaining
Question packs:        89 / 100 remaining
────────────────────────────────────────
Total available:      216 questions

Monthly resets: Feb 1, 2024
Pack questions: Never expire
```
