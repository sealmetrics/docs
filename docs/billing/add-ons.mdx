## Add-on vs Upgrade

### When to Use Add-ons

Add-ons are best when:
- You need more AI questions but your event volume is fine
- Your needs are temporary

### When to Upgrade

Upgrading is better when:
- You consistently need more events
- You need features from a higher tier (BigQuery, webhooks, audit logs)
- Add-on costs approach the upgrade cost

## Question Pack Details

### How Question Packs Work

1. **Purchase:** Buy one or more packs (500 questions each)
2. **Add to balance:** Questions add to your available balance
3. **Use:** Questions deduct from your monthly allowance first, then from purchased packs
4. **Rollover:** Unused pack questions never expire

### Checking Balance

Go to **Settings > Billing** and view the **Lens AI Questions** usage in the Usage card.
