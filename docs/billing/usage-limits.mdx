# Usage & Limits

Learn how Sealmetrics tracks usage, what counts toward your limits, and how to manage overages.

## Pageview Limits

Each plan includes a monthly pageview allowance:

| Plan | Monthly Pageviews |
|------|-------------------|
| Research | 500,000 |
| Guard | 2,000,000 |
| Growth | 10,000,000 |

### What Counts as a Pageview

| Event Type | Counts? | Notes |
|------------|:-------:|-------|
| Page load | ✅ | Standard pageview |
| Virtual pageview (SPA) | ✅ | Single-page app navigation |
| Custom event | ❌ | Events are free |
| Conversion | ❌ | Conversions are free |
| Micro-conversion | ❌ | All events are free |
| API call | ❌ | API usage is separate |

**Example:**

```
User visits 5 pages, adds item to cart, completes purchase

Pageviews counted: 5
Events (free): 2 (add-to-cart, purchase)
Total cost: 5 pageviews
```

### Multi-Account Pageviews

Pageviews are pooled across all accounts in your plan:

```
Plan: Guard (2M pageviews)

Account 1 (main-store.com):    1,200,000 pageviews
Account 2 (blog.company.com):    600,000 pageviews
Account 3 (uk.store.com):        150,000 pageviews
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total used:                    1,950,000 pageviews
Remaining:                        50,000 pageviews
```

| Threshold | Notification Type |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 80% | Email warning |
| 90% | Email + Dashboard alert |
| 100% | Email + Dashboard + In-app popup |
| Overage | Email with usage details |

Configure alerts in **Settings → Notifications → Usage Alerts**.

## Handling Overages

### What Happens When You Exceed

When you exceed your pageview limit:

1. **Tracking continues** - No data is lost
2. **Overage charges apply** - €0.20 per 10,000 pageviews
3. **Notification sent** - You're informed of the overage
4. **Invoice updated** - Charges added to next bill

### Overage Pricing

| Extra Pageviews | Cost |
|-----------------|------|
| 10,000 | €0.20 |
| 100,000 | €2.00 |
| 500,000 | €10.00 |
| 1,000,000 | €20.00 |

### Setting Overage Limits

Prevent unexpected charges:

1. Go to **Settings → Billing → Usage Limits**
2. Set maximum overage amount:

```
Overage Settings
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Maximum monthly overage: €50

When limit reached:
● Stop tracking (data loss)
○ Continue tracking (unlimited overage)
○ Notify me to decide

Email notifications:
☑ Notify at 80% of overage limit
☑ Notify at 100% of overage limit
```

:::warning
If you choose "Stop tracking" when limit is reached, pageviews beyond your limit + overage cap will not be recorded.

## Reducing Usage

### Optimize Tracking

If you're approaching limits, consider:

1. **Exclude internal traffic**
   ```javascript
   _sm('set', 'excludeIPs', ['192.168.1.0/24']);
   ```

2. **Filter bot traffic** (enabled by default)

3. **Exclude staging/development**
   - Don't install pixel on staging environments
   - Use separate test accounts

4. **Sample high-traffic pages**
   ```javascript
   // Track only 10% of homepage traffic
   if (Math.random() < 0.1) {
     _sm('pageview');
   }
   ```

### Monitor by Account

Identify high-usage accounts:

1. Go to **Settings → Usage**
2. View **By Account** breakdown
3. Consider if all accounts need full tracking

Month       Pageviews    Limit      Status
──────────────────────────────────────────
Jan 2024    1,640,000    2,000,000  ✅

Sep 2023    3,200,000    2,000,000  ⚠️ +1.2M overage
```

### Export Usage Data

Download usage reports:

1. Go to **Settings → Usage → Export**
2. Select date range
3. Download CSV

## Planning for Growth

### Upgrade Triggers

Consider upgrading when:

| Trigger | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| 2+ months at 90%+ usage | Upgrade plan |
| Regular overages | Upgrade plan |
| Need more accounts | Upgrade plan |
| Need more team members | Upgrade plan |

### Cost Comparison

When overages become expensive:

```
Scenario: Guard plan, consistently 500K over

Monthly breakdown:
  Guard plan:        €399
  Overage (500K):     €10
  Total:             €409

vs. Growth plan:     €599

Upgrade makes sense when overage > €200/month
(at 1M+ extra pageviews consistently)
```

## FAQ

### Do events count toward pageviews?

No. Only pageviews and virtual pageviews count. All events (conversions, micro-conversions, custom events) are free.

### What happens if I hit my limit mid-month?

Tracking continues and overage charges apply. You can set an overage limit to cap charges.

### Can I buy extra pageviews without upgrading?

Yes, through pageview add-on packs or automatic overage. Overage is simpler for occasional spikes.

### Do unused pageviews roll over?

No. Pageview allowances reset each billing cycle and don't roll over.

### How quickly does usage update?

Usage dashboard updates hourly. Real-time usage may have a ~1 hour delay.
