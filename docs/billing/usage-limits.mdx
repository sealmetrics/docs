# Usage & Limits

Learn how Sealmetrics tracks usage, what counts toward your limits, and how to manage overages.

## Event Limits

Each plan includes a monthly event allowance:

| Plan | Monthly Events | Overage per 100K |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Starter | 1,000,000 | €20 |
| Growth | 5,000,000 | €15 |
| Scale | 25,000,000 | €10 |
| Pro | 100,000,000 | €8 |
| Enterprise | Unlimited | - |

### What Counts as an Event

All tracked interactions count toward your event limit:

| Event Type | Counts? | Notes |
|------------|:-------:|-------|
| Pageview | Yes | Standard page load |
| Virtual pageview (SPA) | Yes | Single-page app navigation |
| Custom event | Yes | User-defined events |
| Conversion | Yes | Purchase, signup, etc. |
| Micro-conversion | Yes | Add-to-cart, etc. |
| AI Agent events | No | Detected agents are tracked but not billed |

**Agent Analytics:** AI agent traffic (bots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) is detected and tracked separately but does **not** count toward your event limit.

### Events Are Pooled

Events are pooled across all websites in your plan:

```
Plan: Growth (5M events)

Website 1 (main-store.com):     3,200,000 events
Website 2 (blog.company.com):     800,000 events
Website 3 (uk.store.com):         650,000 events
----------------------------------------------
Total used:                     4,650,000 events
Remaining:                        350,000 events
```

## Monitoring Usage

## Handling Overages

### What Happens When You Exceed

When you exceed your event limit:

1. **Tracking continues** -- No data is lost
2. **Overage charges apply** -- Billed per 100,000 additional events
3. **Notification sent** -- You're informed of the overage
4. **Invoice updated** -- Charges added to next bill

### Websites and Users

All plans include unlimited websites and unlimited users. There are no limits on the number of sites you can track or team members you can invite.

## Reducing Usage

### Optimize Tracking

If you're approaching limits, consider:

1. **Exclude internal traffic** -- Don't install pixel on staging/development environments

2. **Filter bot traffic** -- Enabled by default, removes known bots

3. **Agent Analytics** -- AI agent events are already excluded from your event count

### Monitor by Website

Identify high-usage websites:

1. Go to **Settings > Billing**
2. View the **Event Usage** card
3. Consider if all websites need full tracking

## Planning for Growth

### Upgrade Triggers

Consider upgrading when:

| Trigger | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| 2+ months at 90%+ usage | Upgrade plan |
| Regular overages | Upgrade plan |
| Need BigQuery | Upgrade to Growth+ |
| Need webhooks/audit logs | Upgrade to Scale+ |

## FAQ

### Do AI agent events count toward my limit?

No. Agent Analytics detects AI agent traffic (bots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) and tracks them separately. These events do not count toward your monthly event limit.

### What happens if I hit my limit mid-month?

Tracking continues and overage charges apply. You'll be notified by email.

### Do unused events roll over?

No. Event allowances reset each billing cycle and don't roll over.

### How quickly does usage update?

Usage data is synced periodically. There may be a short delay before the latest events appear in your usage dashboard.
