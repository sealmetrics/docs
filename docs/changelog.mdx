# Release Notes - November 2025

##Update to the Robot User Agents Database (Nov 21, 6:00 UTC)

We have expanded our internal database of robot-related user agents.  
This update adds **158 new user agents**, improving the accuracy of our identification and filtering systems.

This enhancement provides:

- More reliable detection of automated traffic.  
- Higher precision when distinguishing real users from bots.  
- Better performance across our analytics and security workflows.

Check the rest of the documentation to learn how to take advantage of these improvements in your setup.

##Legal Approval for IP-Based Bot Filtering (Nov 18, 20:00 UTC)

After a thorough legal review, we now have official approval to implement **IP-based filtering** to improve traffic accuracy—without compromising user privacy.

### How It Works

- When a hit arrives, we check whether the IP is in our **bot IP database**  
- If it matches → the hit is **excluded from your analytics**  
- If it doesn’t match → we do **not** store the IP, we simply register it as **human traffic**

### Privacy First

- We do not retain or track IPs that aren't bots  
- No identification or storage of human IPs  
- Full compliance with privacy regulations

This ensures:
- Better protection of your analytics data  
- No compromise on user privacy  
- No personal data is ever stored or exposed

It’s a technical improvement — but also a principle:
You can have precision without violating privacy.
You can have control without crossing the line.

## Facebook Traffic Classification Fix (NEW – Nov 14, 19:00 UTC)

We've improved how SealMetrics classifies Facebook traffic to ensure higher accuracy between **organic** and **paid** sources.

### What Was Happening Before
A minor issue caused some visits containing the **`fbclid`** parameter (but *without* UTM tags) to be incorrectly categorized as **facebook-ads**.

This affected a small portion of traffic, but could distort organic vs. paid Facebook reporting.

### What Changed
As of **Wednesday, November 17 at 19:00 UTC**:

- Traffic containing **only `fbclid`** and **no UTM parameters**  
  → is now classified as **Facebook Organic** (correct behavior)

- Only traffic containing proper **UTM campaign parameters**  
  → is classified as **Facebook Ads**

### Impact on Your Reports
- Improved accuracy in distinguishing paid vs. organic Facebook traffic  
- Expect a slight increase in organic Facebook traffic from this timestamp onward  
- Historical data remains unchanged to preserve consistency

## Performance Improvements (Nov 10, 22:00 UTC)

### 2.5x Faster Data Processing

We've significantly optimized our processing infrastructure by increasing core capacity. Your data now processes **2.5 times faster**, meaning real-time dashboard updates and instant report generation.

**Benefits:**
- Faster dashboard loading times  
- Real-time data updates  
- Instant report generation  
- Improved overall platform responsiveness

## Facebook Ads Attribution Update (Nov 13, 19:00 UTC)

:::warning Breaking Change
As of this release, the `fbclid` parameter is no longer used to identify Facebook Ads traffic due to its lack of reliability and consistency.
:::

**What this means for you:**

- Facebook Ads traffic now **requires properly configured UTM tags** for accurate attribution  
- Ensure your campaigns include parameters such as:  
  - `utm_source=facebook`  
  - `utm_medium=paid`  
  - (or equivalent)  
- This ensures consistent, accurate attribution and full control over your data

**Recommendation:** Review and update your Facebook Ads campaigns with correct UTMs to maintain full visibility.

## Migration Guide

If you're currently relying on `fbclid` for Facebook Ads attribution, follow these steps:

1. **Audit your campaigns:** Check all active Facebook Ads campaigns  
2. **Add UTM parameters:** Configure UTMs in your Facebook Ads Manager  
3. **Test:** Verify traffic attribution inside SealMetrics  
4. **Monitor:** Ensure continuity in your reporting
