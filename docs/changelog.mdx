# Release Notes - November 2025

## 🔧 Facebook Traffic Classification Fix (NEW – Nov 14, 19:00 UTC)

We've improved how SealMetrics classifies Facebook traffic to ensure higher accuracy between **organic** and **paid** sources.

### ✅ What Was Happening Before
A minor issue caused some visits containing the **`fbclid`** parameter (but *without* UTM tags) to be incorrectly categorized as **facebook-ads**.

This affected a small portion of traffic, but could distort organic vs. paid Facebook reporting.

### 🚀 What Changed
As of **Wednesday, November 17 at 19:00 UTC**:

- Traffic containing **only `fbclid`** and **no UTM parameters**  
  → is now classified as **Facebook Organic** (correct behavior)

- Only traffic containing proper **UTM campaign parameters**  
  → is classified as **Facebook Ads**

### 📊 Impact on Your Reports
- Improved accuracy in distinguishing paid vs. organic Facebook traffic  
- Expect a slight increase in organic Facebook traffic from this timestamp onward  
- Historical data remains unchanged to preserve consistency

## 🔄 Facebook Ads Attribution Update ( Nov 13, 19:00 UTC)


:::warning Breaking Change
As of this release, the `fbclid` parameter is no longer used to identify Facebook Ads traffic due to its lack of reliability and consistency.
:::

**What this means for you:**

- Facebook Ads traffic now **requires properly configured UTM tags** for accurate attribution  
- Ensure your campaigns include parameters such as:  
  - `utm_source=facebook`  
  - `utm_medium=paid`  
  - (or equivalent)  
- This ensures consistent, accurate attribution and full control over your data

**Recommendation:** Review and update your Facebook Ads campaigns with correct UTMs to maintain full visibility.
