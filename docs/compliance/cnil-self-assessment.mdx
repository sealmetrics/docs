---

## Part 2: Technical Criteria (14 Points)

### Criterion 1: Purpose Limitation
**Requirement:** Tool must be used exclusively for audience measurement for the publisher's own account.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| Single-purpose tool | ✅ Sealmetrics is exclusively for analytics |
| Publisher's own account | ✅ Each client has isolated account |
| No secondary uses | ✅ No advertising, profiling, or resale |

**Configuration:** Default configuration. No additional setup required.

---

| Statistical anonymization | ✅ Data aggregated before display |

**Configuration:** Built into platform architecture. Cannot be disabled.

---

### Criterion 3: No Cross-Site Tracking
**Requirement:** Cannot track users across different websites or applications.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| First-party only | ✅ No third-party cookies |
| Domain-isolated identifiers | ✅ Session IDs unique per domain |
| No unified IDs | ✅ No cross-domain identification |

**Technical Implementation:**
```
Session ID scope: Single domain only
Cookie scope: First-party, same-site
Cross-domain tracking: Not possible by design
```

---

### Criterion 4: No Data Cross-Referencing
**Requirement:** Cannot cross-reference analytics data with other processing activities.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| Isolated data processing | ✅ Analytics data stays in Sealmetrics |
| No CRM integration for profiling | ✅ No user-level data merge |
| No external enrichment | ✅ No third-party data added |

**Configuration:** Platform architecture prevents data cross-referencing. API exports only aggregated statistics.

---

### Criterion 5: No Third-Party Data Transmission
**Requirement:** Cannot transmit non-anonymized data to third parties.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| No data sales | ✅ Sealmetrics never sells data |
| No third-party sharing | ✅ No data shared with external parties |
| Client owns their data | ✅ Data belongs exclusively to client |

**Legal Basis:** [Sealmetrics Privacy Policy](https://sealmetrics.com/privacy-policy) and [DPA](https://sealmetrics.com/dpa) guarantee no third-party data sharing.

---

### Criterion 6: Cookie Lifetime ≤ 13 Months
**Requirement:** Cookie validity must not exceed 13 months, without automatic renewal.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| Cookie duration | ✅ **No persistent cookies used** |
| Session-based identification | ✅ Session IDs expire with browser session |
| No automatic renewal | ✅ N/A - no persistent storage |

**Technical Implementation:**
```
Storage method: Session-based (no cookies in default mode)
Maximum theoretical lifetime: Browser session only
```

**Note:** Sealmetrics exceeds this requirement by not using persistent cookies at all in standard configuration.

---

### Criterion 7: Data Retention ≤ 25 Months
**Requirement:** Collected data must not be retained beyond 25 months.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| Analytics data retention | ✅ 25 months maximum |
| Automatic deletion | ✅ Data purged after retention period |
| Raw logs retention | ✅ 14 days only |

**Data Retention Schedule:**
| Data Type | Retention Period |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Raw request logs | 14 days |
| Aggregated analytics | 25 months |
| Account configuration | Until account deletion |

---

### Criterion 8: IP Address Anonymization
**Requirement:** IP addresses must be anonymized (last octet removed minimum).

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| IP processing | ✅ **IP addresses not collected** |
| Geolocation method | ✅ Derived from timezone, not IP |
| No IP storage | ✅ IP never stored or logged |

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Sealmetrics does NOT collect IP addresses
// Country detection uses browser timezone API:
Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone
```

**Note:** Sealmetrics exceeds this requirement by not processing IP addresses at all.

---

### Criterion 9: Geolocation Precision Limit
**Requirement:** Geolocation must not be more precise than postal code level.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| Location precision | ✅ Country level only |
| No precise geolocation | ✅ No city/region/postal code |
| Privacy-preserving method | ✅ Timezone-based detection |

**Geolocation Data Collected:**
- Country (derived from timezone)
- No region, city, or postal code
- No GPS or IP-based location

---

### Criterion 10: Independent Data Collection Per Publisher
**Requirement:** For services serving multiple publishers, data collection must be independent for each.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| Client data isolation | ✅ Complete separation |
| No shared identifiers | ✅ Each account has unique tracking |
| Independent databases | ✅ Logical separation per account |

**Architecture:**
```
Account A ──► Isolated dataset A ──► Reports A only
Account B ──► Isolated dataset B ──► Reports B only
                    ↓
         No cross-account access possible
```

---

### Criterion 11: Totally Independent Trackers
**Requirement:** Trackers must be completely independent with no interdependencies.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| Unique tracking IDs | ✅ Each account has unique ID |
| No shared infrastructure impact | ✅ Client A cannot affect Client B |
| Independent configuration | ✅ Each account configured separately |

**Implementation:**
```html
<!-- Each client gets unique, independent tracker -->
<script src="https://t.sealmetrics.com/t.js?id=UNIQUE_ACCOUNT_ID" defer></script>
```

---

### Criterion 12: User Information Requirement
**Requirement:** Users must be informed about analytics via privacy policy.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| Documentation provided | ✅ Privacy policy template available |
| Clear information | ✅ Plain language explanation |
| Purpose explanation | ✅ Audience measurement stated |

**Recommended Privacy Policy Text:**
```
This website uses Sealmetrics for audience measurement. This tool
is configured to comply with CNIL guidelines for consent exemption.
It collects anonymous statistical data only, does not use cookies,
and does not track you across websites. You can block analytics
using your browser's privacy settings or an ad blocker.
```

---

### Criterion 13: Opt-Out Mechanism
**Requirement:** Users must have ability to refuse audience measurement.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| Opt-out available | ✅ Yes - via browser settings or site implementation |
| Easy to access | ✅ Standard browser controls |
| No individual tracking | ✅ Nothing personal to opt out of |

**Important Context:**

Sealmetrics does **not use localStorage, cookies, or any persistent storage** by default. This means:
- There is no individual user tracking to opt out of
- Data is collected as aggregate statistics only
- Each pageview is independent with no user identification

**Opt-Out Methods:**

1. **Browser-level blocking** - Users can block the tracking script using browser privacy settings or ad blockers
2. **Publisher-implemented opt-out** - Site owners can implement conditional script loading based on user preference

```html
<!-- Example: Publisher-implemented opt-out -->
<script>
  if (!localStorage.getItem('analytics_optout')) {
    var s = document.createElement('script');
    s.src = 'https://pixel.sealmetrics.com/t.js?id=YOUR_ID';
    s.defer = true;
    document.head.appendChild(s);
  }
</script>
```

**Note:** Since Sealmetrics collects only aggregate statistics without individual identification, the opt-out requirement is satisfied by standard browser controls.

---

### Criterion 14: No Reuse by Provider
**Requirement:** Analytics provider cannot reuse data for their own commercial purposes.

| Aspect | Compliance |
|--------|------------|
| No data monetization | ✅ Sealmetrics never sells data |
| No model training | ✅ Client data not used for AI/ML |
| No benchmarking without consent | ✅ No cross-client analysis |

**Legal Guarantee:** Our [Terms of Service](https://sealmetrics.com/terms) and [DPA](https://sealmetrics.com/dpa) legally prohibit any reuse of client data.
