# Data Law Consolidation: From 5 Acts to 2

The EU Digital Omnibus achieves one of the most significant simplifications in European regulatory history: consolidating five separate data laws into two. This consolidation eliminates overlaps, reduces compliance complexity, and creates a coherent framework for Europe's data economy.

## The Current Fragmentation

### Five Separate Data Laws

Before the Omnibus, organizations navigating EU data regulation must comply with five distinct legal instruments:

#### 1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
**Regulation (EU) 2016/679**

**Scope**: Processing of personal data

**Focus**:
- Individual rights (access, erasure, portability)
- Lawful processing bases
- Controller and processor obligations
- Supervisory authority enforcement

**Status**: Foundational regulation, not repealed

#### 2. Free Flow of Data Regulation (FFDR)
**Regulation (EU) 2018/1807**

**Scope**: Free movement of non-personal data

**Focus**:
- Prohibition of data localization requirements
- Professional user data portability
- Self-regulatory codes of conduct
- Regulatory barriers monitoring

**Current problem**: Creates artificial distinction between personal/non-personal data that is difficult to apply in practice

#### 3. Data Governance Act (DGA)
**Regulation (EU) 2022/868**

**Scope**: Framework for trusted data sharing

**Focus**:
- Re-use of protected public sector data
- Data intermediation services (registration regime)
- Data altruism organizations
- European data innovation board

**Current problem**: Only 27 registered data intermediaries despite expectations of 100-150; heavy compliance burden

#### 4. Open Data Directive (ODD)
**Directive (EU) 2019/1024**

**Scope**: Public sector information re-use

**Focus**:
- Open data by default
- High-value datasets publication
- Charging principles
- Exclusive arrangements prohibition

**Current problem**: Overlaps with DGA on public sector data; creates confusion on which regime applies

#### 5. Data Act
**Regulation (EU) 2023/2854**

**Scope**: Data access and sharing rights

**Focus**:
- User access to IoT device data
- Data holder obligations to share with users
- Business-to-business data sharing
- Switching between data processing services
- Public sector access in emergencies

**Current problem**: Newest regulation, but already needs integration with older frameworks

### The Complexity Problem

**For businesses:**
- Must navigate five separate legal texts
- Overlapping definitions create uncertainty
- Different compliance procedures
- Multiple reporting obligations
- High legal advisory costs

**For regulators:**
- Fragmented enforcement
- Inconsistent interpretation
- Coordination challenges
- Resource inefficiency

**For innovation:**
- Legal uncertainty deters investment
- Compliance complexity favors large players
- Difficult to build pan-European data services
- Regulatory burden slows deployment

## The Consolidation Solution

### Result: 2 Laws

**After the Digital Omnibus:**

1. **GDPR (amended)**: Governs all personal data processing
2. **Data Act (consolidated)**: Governs all other data economy rules

### Why GDPR Remains Separate

The GDPR is **amended but not merged** because:

**Distinct purpose**: Fundamental rights protection vs. economic framework

**Different legal basis**: Article 16 TFEU (data protection) vs. Article 114 TFEU (internal market)

**Special enforcement**: Data protection authorities with independence guarantees

**International standard**: GDPR is globally recognized; maintaining as standalone regulation preserves its status

**Proportionality**: Personal data rules deserve distinct treatment given fundamental rights implications

## What Moves Into the Data Act

### From FFDR: Data Localization Ban

**FFDR Article 4** prohibition on data localization requirements becomes **Data Act Article 32h**.

**Content**:
> Member States shall not impose data localisation requirements that restrict the storage or processing of data in a specific geographical location within the Union.

**Exceptions maintained**:
- National security justified restrictions
- Public interest requirements (proportionate and necessary)

**Rationale for consolidation**: Data localization affects all data (personal and non-personal), so better integrated into comprehensive Data Act rather than separate regulation.

**What happens to rest of FFDR**: Mostly repealed; portability provisions absorbed into Data Act Chapter V (switching).

### From DGA: Data Intermediation Services

**DGA Chapter III** (Articles 9-15) moves to **Data Act Chapter VIIa**.

**What's included**:
- Data intermediation service provider definition
- Notification and registration (now voluntary—see below)
- Neutrality and transparency requirements
- Code of conduct framework
- Competent authority designation

**Key changes in consolidation**:
- **Notification becomes voluntary** (trust label system instead)
- **Separate legal entity requirement removed** (functional separation sufficient)
- Streamlined registration process
- Lighter monitoring obligations

**Services covered**:
- Data sharing platforms
- Data marketplaces
- Data cooperatives
- Personal data intermediaries

### From DGA: Data Altruism Organizations

**DGA Chapter IV** (Articles 16-28) moves to **Data Act Chapter VIIa**.

**What's included**:
- Data altruism definition (voluntary sharing for general interest)
- Registration of recognized data altruism organizations
- Transparency requirements
- European data altruism consent form
- Oversight mechanisms

**Key changes in consolidation**:
- **Rulebook requirement deleted** (too burdensome for voluntary activity)
- **National policy reporting deleted**
- Simplified compliance
- Easier registration

**Purpose**: Enable citizens and companies to donate data for research, statistics, and public interest purposes.

### From DGA: Protected Public Sector Data

**DGA Chapter II** (Articles 3-8) moves to **Data Act Chapter VIIa**.

**What's included**:
- Re-use of protected data held by public sector bodies
- Single information points
- Competent bodies for re-use requests
- Conditions and fees
- Non-discrimination requirements

**Integration rationale**: Fits naturally with Data Act's public sector data access provisions (emergency access, high-value datasets).

### From Open Data Directive: Public Sector Information

**Entire ODD framework** moves to **Data Act Chapter VIIc**.

**What's included**:
- Open data by default principle
- High-value datasets identification and publication
- Real-time data access
- Charging principles (marginal cost)
- Prohibition of exclusive arrangements
- Research data access

**Benefits of consolidation**:
- Single regime for all public sector data
- No more confusion between DGA and ODD
- Harmonized charging rules
- One-stop shop for public data access

**Member States**: Must transpose ODD provisions into national law (Directive obligations); now superseded by directly applicable Data Act provisions (Regulation).

## What Gets Fully Repealed

### Platform-to-Business Regulation (P2B)

**Regulation (EU) 2019/1150** is **fully repealed**.

**Why**: Completely superseded by Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA).

**DSA coverage**:
- Platform transparency obligations
- Terms and conditions requirements
- Algorithmic transparency
- Complaint handling mechanisms

**DMA coverage**:
- Gatekeeper obligations
- Fair treatment requirements
- Data access for business users
- Interoperability mandates

**Result**: P2B obligations now covered (and exceeded) by DSA/DMA; no need for separate regime.

**Transition**: Existing P2B compliance efforts seamlessly transfer to DSA/DMA compliance.

### Most of Free Flow of Data Regulation

**FFDR mostly repealed** except:
- Article 4 (data localization ban) → moves to Data Act
- Core free movement principle preserved in recitals

**What's deleted**:
- Separate monitoring framework (€846,612/year savings for public authorities)
- Standalone portability provisions (covered by Data Act switching rules)
- Code of conduct facilitation (redundant with Data Act mechanisms)

## Correlation Tables: Article-by-Article Mapping

The Digital Omnibus includes detailed **Annexes** with correlation tables showing exactly where each article of the repealed regulations moves in the consolidated framework.

### Example: DGA to Data Act Mapping

| DGA Article | Topic | New Location |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Articles 3-8 | Protected public sector data | Data Act Chapter VIIa, Section 1 |
| Articles 9-15 | Data intermediation services | Data Act Chapter VIIa, Section 2 |
| Articles 16-28 | Data altruism | Data Act Chapter VIIa, Section 3 |
| Articles 29-32 | Competent authorities | Data Act Chapter VIIa, Section 4 |
| Article 33 | European Data Innovation Board | Data Act Chapter VIIa, Section 5 |

### Example: ODD to Data Act Mapping

| ODD Chapter | Topic | New Location |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Chapter I | General provisions | Data Act Chapter VIIc, Section 1 |
| Chapter II | Re-use requests | Data Act Chapter VIIc, Section 2 |
| Chapter III | High-value datasets | Data Act Chapter VIIc, Section 3 |
| Chapter IV | Research data | Data Act Chapter VIIc, Section 4 |

**Practical value**: Legal counsel and compliance teams can trace every obligation from old law to new location.

## Benefits of Consolidation

### 1. Single Legal Framework for Data Economy

**Before**: Navigate GDPR + FFDR + DGA + ODD + Data Act

**After**: Navigate GDPR (personal) + Data Act (everything else)

**Impact**:
- Simpler compliance mapping
- Reduced legal advisory costs
- Easier training for compliance teams
- Better accessibility for SMEs

### 2. Harmonized Definitions

**Current problem**: Same concepts defined differently across laws.

**Examples**:
- "Data holder" in Data Act vs. "data controller" in GDPR
- "Data intermediary" in DGA vs. "data processing service" in Data Act
- "Public sector body" in ODD vs. DGA

**Consolidation solution**: Single set of definitions in Data Act applicable to all non-personal data provisions.

**Result**: Legal certainty, consistent interpretation, predictable enforcement.

### 3. Reduced Compliance Complexity

**Fewer registers to check**:
- Before: National DGA registers + Data Act registers + ODD high-value datasets
- After: Unified Data Act registers

**Fewer notifications**:
- Before: Separate DGA intermediation notification + Data Act switching notification
- After: Integrated notification process (and voluntary for intermediation)

**Fewer competent authorities**:
- Before: DGA authority + ODD authority + Data Act authority
- After: Single Data Act competent authority per Member State

### 4. Easier Compliance Navigation

**Single regulatory text**: Instead of cross-referencing five laws, consult two.

**Integrated obligations**: Related requirements in same chapters instead of scattered across regulations.

**Unified enforcement**: One competent authority for data economy (excluding personal data).

**Better guidance**: Regulators can issue comprehensive guidance on Data Act instead of fragmented guidance across multiple laws.

### 5. Supports Innovation

**Legal certainty**: Clear rules encourage investment in data-driven services.

**Lower barriers to entry**: Simplified compliance helps startups and SMEs compete.

**Pan-European services**: Easier to build services across all Member States with unified framework.

**Faster deployment**: Less time spent on legal analysis, more on product development.

## Cost Savings from Consolidation

### Direct Regulatory Savings

**FFDR monitoring relief**: €846,612/year for public authorities
- No separate monitoring framework
- Resources redirected to Data Act implementation

**DGA separate entity removal**: €318,750 one-off savings
- Data intermediaries no longer need separate legal entities
- Functional separation sufficient

**DGA monitoring simplification**: €6M/year
- Lighter oversight regime
- Risk-based supervision instead of continuous monitoring

### Indirect Business Savings

**Reduced legal advisory**: Fewer laws to analyze and cross-reference

**Simpler compliance procedures**: Unified processes instead of parallel tracks

**Lower training costs**: Staff learn one framework instead of five

**Faster market entry**: Less time from idea to launch for data services

### Public Sector Efficiency

**One competent authority per Member State** instead of multiple:
- Shared expertise
- Consistent interpretation
- Better resource allocation
- Coordinated enforcement

## Implementation Considerations

### Transitional Provisions

**Existing DGA registrations**: Automatically transfer to Data Act regime
- No need to re-register
- Existing rights and obligations continue
- Can opt in to new voluntary regime benefits

**ODD transposition**: Member States that transposed ODD Directive can repeal national laws once Data Act provisions apply
- Directly applicable regulation supersedes national transposition
- Simplifies national legal landscape

**FFDR compliance**: Organizations already complying with FFDR data localization ban continue under Data Act Article 32h
- No substantive change to obligations
- Same exemptions apply

### For Organizations

**Compliance mapping**:
1. Identify which regulations currently apply to your activities
2. Use correlation tables to find new Data Act provisions
3. Update internal policies and procedures
4. Train compliance teams on consolidated framework

**Documentation updates**:
- Privacy policies and transparency documents
- Data processing agreements
- Compliance manuals
- Training materials

**Legal basis review**:
- Ensure legal bases remain valid under consolidated framework
- Update references from repealed regulations to Data Act
- Consider new opportunities from simplified regime
