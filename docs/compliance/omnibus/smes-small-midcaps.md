# SME and Small Mid-Cap Exemptions

The EU Digital Omnibus introduces a new category of protected businesses: **Small Mid-Caps (SMCs)**. By extending exemptions and simplifications to companies with up to 749 employees, the regulation eliminates the "cliff edge" compliance burden that hits growing businesses and saves an estimated €5-19 million annually across the European economy.

## The Growth Problem

### The SME Cliff Edge

Under current EU law, businesses enjoy lighter regulatory treatment while they qualify as **SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises)**:

**SME definition (Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC)**:
- Fewer than 250 employees
- AND either:
  - Annual turnover ≤ €50 million, OR
  - Balance sheet total ≤ €43 million

**Examples of SME exemptions**:
- GDPR Article 30: No processing record requirement (with exceptions)
- Simplified audit requirements
- Lighter reporting obligations
- Reduced fees for certifications

### What Happens at 250 Employees

**The cliff edge**: A company crossing from 249 to 250 employees suddenly faces:
- Full GDPR Article 30 processing records
- Complete Data Act compliance
- All AI Act obligations without transition
- Higher fees for data access requests
- Maximum regulatory burden overnight

**Real-world impact**:
- Growth deterrent (companies delay hiring)
- Compliance shock (sudden cost increase)
- Resource strain (must rapidly build compliance infrastructure)
- Competitive disadvantage vs. companies that stayed below threshold

**Economic inefficiency**: A company with 250 employees is not fundamentally different from one with 249, yet faces drastically different regulatory treatment.

## The Solution: Small Mid-Caps (SMCs)

### New Category: SMCs

The Digital Omnibus creates an intermediate category between SMEs and large enterprises:

**Small Mid-Cap (SMC) definition**:
- **250-749 employees**
- AND either:
  - Annual turnover ≤ €150 million, OR
  - Balance sheet total ≤ €129 million

**Rationale**: Companies in this range are still growing, resource-constrained, and deserve proportionate regulation.

### How Many Companies Qualify?

**Approximately 38,000 companies** across the EU fall into the SMC category.

**Sectors with high SMC presence**:
- Technology and software
- Manufacturing
- Professional services
- Healthcare providers
- Logistics and transportation
- Hospitality and tourism

**Geographic distribution**: Concentrated in larger Member States (Germany, France, Italy, Spain) but present in all EU countries.

## Extended Exemptions for SMCs

### 1. Public Sector Data Access Fees

**Current rule (Data Act)**: SMEs can request waiver of fees for accessing public sector data

**Extended**: SMCs also qualify for fee waivers

**Savings**: Approximately €500 per data access application

**Use cases**:
- Weather data for logistics optimization
- Geographic data for urban planning services
- Traffic data for mobility applications
- Public procurement data for market analysis

**Annual impact**: €5-19 million savings across SMC sector (based on estimated application volumes)

**Benefit**: Levels playing field with large enterprises that can more easily absorb data access costs

### 2. Data Intermediation Compliance

**Current complexity**: Data intermediation service providers face heavy compliance burden

**Extended**: SMCs receive simplified compliance pathways for data intermediation services

**Simplifications**:
- Lighter monitoring requirements
- Reduced documentation burden
- Proportionate transparency obligations
- Risk-based supervision

**Impact**: Encourages SMCs to offer data intermediation services (data marketplaces, sharing platforms, cooperatives) without prohibitive compliance costs

**Market effect**: More competition in data intermediation market; benefits data providers and users

### 3. Cloud Switching Requirements

**Data Act Chapter V**: Rules for switching between cloud and data processing services

**Extended**: SMCs receive lighter regime for:
- Switching assistance obligations (as providers)
- Contract transparency (as users)
- Data portability implementation (as providers)

**Rationale**: SMC cloud providers don't have resources of hyperscalers; proportionate rules enable competition

**Benefit**: SMC cloud providers can compete without matching compliance investment of AWS/Azure/Google Cloud

### 4. Browser Signal Implementation (GDPR Article 88b)

**Article 88b(6)**: Browsers must provide technical means for consent signals

**Exemption**: **SME browser providers are exempt**

**Extended to SMCs**: Since browsers are software products, SMC browser vendors (if any) would also be exempt

**Practical impact**: Limited (most browsers are from large tech companies), but removes barrier for innovative browser startups that grow into SMC size

**Examples**: Brave, Vivaldi, or regional browsers could grow to SMC size without facing Article 88b(6) implementation burden

### 5. AI Act Compliance (via AI Omnibus)

**Separate proposal**: AI Omnibus (COM(2025) 836) extends AI Act exemptions to SMCs

**Extended provisions**:
- Longer compliance timelines for high-risk AI systems
- Simplified conformity assessment procedures
- Reduced technical documentation requirements
- Lighter post-market monitoring obligations

**Coordination**: AI Omnibus and Digital Omnibus work together for coherent SME/SMC treatment across digital regulations

**Impact**: SMC AI developers can innovate without compliance burden designed for large AI labs

## GDPR Article 30 Extension (Proposed)

### Current GDPR Article 30

**Article 30(5)** exempts SMEs from maintaining processing records **unless**:
- Processing is high-risk
- Processing includes special categories (Article 9) or criminal data (Article 10)
- Processing is regular and systematic

**In practice**: Most SMEs must maintain records anyway due to exceptions

### Omnibus IV Proposal

**Separate legislative proposal** (Omnibus IV) currently under discussion:

**Proposal**: Extend Article 30(5) exemption to SMCs

**Status**: Being negotiated by European Parliament and Council (not part of Digital Omnibus COM(2025) 837)

**Expected timeline**: Adoption in 2026-2027

**If adopted**: SMCs would not need processing records unless high-risk/special categories/regular systematic processing

**Savings**: Significant reduction in administrative burden for SMCs (records require substantial compliance resources)

**Note**: This is separate from the Digital Omnibus but demonstrates broader EU policy of proportionate SMC treatment

### Determining Your Category

**Step 1**: Count employees
- Include full-time equivalent (FTE)
- Include employees in parent and subsidiary companies (group concept)

**Step 2**: Calculate annual turnover OR balance sheet total
- Based on last approved accounting period
- Consolidate group accounts if applicable

**Step 3**: Apply thresholds

| Category | Employees | Turnover | Balance Sheet |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Micro** | < 10 | ≤ €2M | ≤ €2M |
| **Small** | < 50 | ≤ €10M | ≤ €10M |
| **Medium (SME)** | < 250 | ≤ €50M | ≤ €43M |
| **SMC (NEW)** | 250-749 | ≤ €150M | ≤ €129M |
| **Large** | ≥ 750 | > €150M | > €129M |

**Note**: You must meet employee threshold AND (turnover OR balance sheet). If you exceed both turnover AND balance sheet but are under employee threshold, you're still in the category.

**Example 1**:
- 300 employees
- €80M turnover
- €60M balance sheet
- **Result**: SMC (employees 250-749, turnover ≤ €150M)

**Example 2**:
- 600 employees
- €200M turnover
- €180M balance sheet
- **Result**: Large enterprise (exceeds SMC thresholds)

**Example 3**:
- 240 employees
- €70M turnover
- €50M balance sheet
- **Result**: SME (under 250 employees, even though financials exceed SME limits)

**Post-Brexit**: UK considering similar SME/SMC distinctions in data and digital regulation

**Status**: Proposals under discussion; no implemented SMC category yet

**Convergence**: Likely UK will adopt similar approach for competitiveness

### Asia-Pacific

**Varied approaches**:
- Japan: Some SME exemptions in data protection law
- South Korea: Tiered compliance based on business size
- Australia: Limited SME exemptions

**EU leadership**: SMC category is innovative; may influence global regulatory design

## Practical Guidance for SMCs

### If You Qualify as SMC

**Step 1**: Verify your status
- Calculate employees, turnover, balance sheet
- Confirm you meet 250-749 employee threshold
- Check financial thresholds

**Step 2**: Identify applicable exemptions
- Public sector data access: Apply for fee waivers
- Data intermediation: Use simplified compliance
- Cloud services: Leverage lighter switching regime
- AI Act: Monitor AI Omnibus adoption for extended timelines

**Step 3**: Update compliance documentation
- Privacy policies: Reflect proportionate obligations
- Data processing records: Check if GDPR Article 30(5) extension applies (Omnibus IV)
- Vendor contracts: Negotiate based on SMC status

**Step 4**: Engage with regulators
- National competent authorities may have SMC-specific guidance
- Participate in industry consultations
- Seek clarification on borderline cases

### If You're Growing Toward SMC Status

**Plan ahead**:
- Track employee count and financials
- Anticipate threshold crossing
- Budget for compliance changes

**Smooth transition from SME to SMC**:
- Incremental compliance build-up
- No cliff edge (extended exemptions continue)
- More time to mature compliance functions

**Growing from SMC to large enterprise**:
- At 750 employees or financial thresholds, exemptions end
- Plan 6-12 months ahead for full compliance
- Consider phased hiring to manage transition

## Limitations and Conditions

### Not All Exemptions Apply

**SMC status does NOT exempt from**:
- Core GDPR obligations (lawful basis, transparency, security)
- Fundamental data subject rights
- High-risk processing safeguards
- Sector-specific regulations (financial services, healthcare)

**SMC exemptions are limited to**:
- Proportionate administrative requirements
- Fee reductions
- Simplified reporting
- Lighter documentation (where risk permits)

### Group Company Rules

**Parent-subsidiary relationships**:
- Employee count includes entire group
- Financial thresholds consolidate group accounts
- Cannot split company to qualify for SMC status

**Example**: Parent company with 100 employees and subsidiary with 200 employees = 300 total (SMC category)

### Monitoring and Enforcement

**Abuse prevention**:
- Supervisory authorities can challenge SMC status claims
- Must demonstrate genuine compliance with thresholds
- Artificial structuring to gain SMC status may be disregarded

**Verification**:
- Based on audited accounts where applicable
- Self-certification with potential spot checks
- Penalties for fraudulent claims

## Future Developments

**Status**: Co-legislators negotiating

**Expected**: Adoption 2026-2027

**Impact**: Major administrative relief for SMCs (no processing records unless high-risk)

### AI Omnibus (Parallel)

**Proposal**: COM(2025) 836

**SMC provisions**:
- Extended AI Act timelines
- Simplified conformity assessment
- Lighter documentation

**Status**: Legislative process (parallel to Digital Omnibus)

**Expected**: Adoption 2026-2027

### Broader SMC Policy

**EU trend**: Recognizing SMCs as distinct category across regulations

**Future areas**:
