## Background: UK PECR Changes 2026

### Data Use and Access Act 2025

The **Data Use and Access Act 2025** (DUAA) received Royal Assent on **November 7, 2025** and takes effect on **February 5, 2026**. It introduces significant changes to UK PECR, including a new exemption for analytics cookies and similar technologies.

### Key Changes for Analytics

Prior to DUAA 2025, UK PECR required consent for **all** cookies except those "strictly necessary" for service delivery. The new legislation introduces an **analytics exemption** similar to existing frameworks in France (CNIL) and other EU member states.

### Legal Reference

> **Section 99 of DUAA 2025** amends PECR Regulation 6 to allow storing or accessing information on a user's terminal equipment without consent when the **sole purpose** is to obtain or compile statistical information about the use of an information society service, subject to specific conditions.

---

## Part 1: Analytics Exemption Conditions

The UK analytics exemption requires **all four conditions** to be met:

### Condition 1: Sole Purpose - Aggregate Statistics
**Requirement:** The sole purpose must be to obtain or compile statistical information about the use of an information society service.

| Criterion | Sealmetrics Compliance |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Purpose limited to statistics | ✅ Yes - only audience measurement |
| No secondary purposes | ✅ No advertising, profiling, or resale |
| Aggregate data only | ✅ All reports show aggregated statistics |

**Evidence:** Sealmetrics is a purpose-built analytics tool that produces only aggregate statistical reports. Individual user tracking, profiling, and advertising are architecturally impossible.

---

### Condition 2: Clear User Information
**Requirement:** The subscriber or user must have been provided with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes of storing or accessing the information.

| Criterion | Sealmetrics Compliance |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Information provided | ✅ Privacy policy templates available |
| Clear language | ✅ Plain English explanations |
| Comprehensive coverage | ✅ All data collection explained |

**Recommended Privacy Policy Text:**
```
This website uses Sealmetrics for audience measurement. This is a privacy-first
analytics tool that collects aggregate statistics only. It does not use cookies,
does not track you across websites, and does not collect personal information.
You can opt out at any time at [opt-out link].
```

---

### Condition 3: Simple Opt-Out Mechanism
**Requirement:** The subscriber or user must have been given a simple means, free of charge, of refusing storage or access to that information.

| Criterion | Sealmetrics Compliance |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Opt-out available | ✅ Yes |
| Simple to use | ✅ Single-click opt-out |
| Free of charge | ✅ No cost to user |
| Easily accessible | ✅ Can be added to any page |

**Opt-Out Implementation:**
```javascript
// Users can opt out with:
localStorage.setItem('sealmetrics_optout', 'true');

// Or via universal opt-out page:
// https://sealmetrics.com/opt-out
```

**Publisher Implementation:**
```html
<!-- Add to privacy policy or footer -->
<a href="#" onclick="localStorage.setItem('sealmetrics_optout','true');alert('You have opted out of analytics.');">
  Opt out of analytics
</a>
```

---

### Condition 4: No Advertising Use
**Requirement:** The information cannot be used for purposes relating to advertising.

| Criterion | Sealmetrics Compliance |
|-----------|----------------------|
| No advertising features | ✅ Not available in Sealmetrics |
| No ad targeting | ✅ Architecturally impossible |
| No retargeting data | ✅ No data shared for ads |
| No ad networks | ✅ No third-party integrations |

**Evidence:** Sealmetrics has no advertising features, no integration with ad platforms, and no capability to share data with advertising networks. The platform is designed exclusively for audience measurement.

## Part 4: Comparison with Previous UK Requirements

### Before February 5, 2026

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Consent required for all analytics | ✅ Required |
| Exception for "strictly necessary" only | Limited |
| Analytics = consent required | Yes |

### After February 5, 2026

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Analytics exemption available | ✅ Yes |
| Conditions must be met | 4 conditions |
| Advertising use prohibited | ✅ Required |
| Opt-out must be provided | ✅ Required |

---

## Part 5: ICO Enforcement Considerations

### Increased Penalties Under DUAA 2025

The Data Use and Access Act 2025 increases maximum penalties for PECR violations:

| Penalty Type | Maximum |
|--------------|---------|
| **Standard maximum** | £17.5 million |
| **Turnover-based** | 4% of worldwide annual turnover |
| **Applicable** | Whichever is higher |

### ICO Enforcement Priorities

The ICO has indicated focus on:
- **Advertising-related cookies** without consent
- **Third-party tracking** without valid legal basis
- **Inadequate user information** about data collection
- **Missing or difficult opt-out mechanisms**

**Sealmetrics Advantage:** By design, Sealmetrics cannot be used for advertising or cross-site tracking, eliminating the highest-risk compliance concerns.
