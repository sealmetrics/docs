# Attribution FAQ

## What attribution model does Sealmetrics use?

Last click.

Under privacy regulations, it is the only model that does not require consent.

---

## Why not use multi-touch attribution?

Multi-touch requires identification of users across sessions, which is not compliant without consent.  
Sealmetrics avoids all user-level tracking.

---

## Can Sealmetrics read and attribute UTMs?

Yes.  
UTMs are captured on every hit and stored without any personal data.

---

## Does campaign tracking require consent?

No.  
Attribution is based on hit-level data, not user tracking.
