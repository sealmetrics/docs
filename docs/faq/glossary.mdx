# Glossary

A comprehensive reference of all terms used throughout SealMetrics documentation. For detailed metric formulas and benchmarks, see the [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions).

---

## A

### Aggregated Data

Data that is summarized so it cannot be linked back to any individual. SealMetrics processes pageviews ("hits") independently without reconstructing user profiles.

### API (Application Programming Interface)

A programmatic interface for extracting analytics data, automating workflows, or integrating SealMetrics with external tools. See the [API documentation](/api).

### Attribution

The method used to assign a conversion to a traffic source. SealMetrics uses last-click attribution, the only model fully compatible with consentless analytics.

### Average Order Value (AOV)

The average revenue per conversion. Calculated as Total Revenue divided by Number of Conversions. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#average-order-value-aov).

---

## B

### Batch API

A way to execute multiple analytics queries in a single HTTP request, reducing latency and simplifying integrations. See the [Batch API guide](/api/batch).

### Bounce Rate

The percentage of sessions where the visitor viewed only one page and then left. A lower bounce rate generally indicates better engagement. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#bounce-rate).

### Browser

The web browser used to access your site (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge). Reported under the Devices report.

---

## C

### CCPA

California Consumer Privacy Act -- regulates collection of personal data in California. SealMetrics is compliant because it collects no personal data.

### Channel

A classification of traffic into high-level groups such as Organic Search, Paid Search, Social, Direct, Email, and Referral. Channels are derived automatically from UTM parameters and referrer data. See [Sources report](/reports/sources).

### CNIL / AEPD

French and Spanish data protection authorities whose guidelines define how analytics can operate without consent. SealMetrics follows both strictly. See [Compliance](/compliance).

### Consent Mode

Google's mechanism for restricting tracking based on user consent status. SealMetrics does not use Consent Mode and must not be blocked by consent banners.

### Content Group

A user-defined label assigned to pages so you can analyze sections of your site as a group (e.g., "Blog", "Products", "Checkout"). See [Content Grouping guide](/implementation/content-grouping).

### Content Grouping

The practice of assigning labels to pages to analyze site sections as groups. Configured via the tracker or the SealMetrics dashboard. See [Content Grouping guide](/implementation/content-grouping).

### Conversion

A completed goal event such as a purchase, signup, or lead form submission, tracked with `sealmetrics.conv()`. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#conversions).

### Conversion Rate

The percentage of sessions that resulted in at least one conversion. Calculated as Sessions with Conversions divided by Total Sessions, multiplied by 100. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#conversion-rate).

### Cookieless Tracking

Analytics without cookies, fingerprinting, or persistent identifiers. SealMetrics tracks isolated hits while remaining compliant with GDPR and ePrivacy. See [Consentless Analytics FAQ](/faq/consentless-analytics).

### Cookies

Small files stored on a user's device to identify them across sessions. SealMetrics uses zero cookies.

### Cost per Acquisition (CPA)

The average cost to acquire one conversion. Calculated as Total Ad Spend divided by Total Conversions. Requires external cost data import.

---

## D

### Data Minimization

The principle of collecting only what is strictly necessary. SealMetrics collects minimal data per hit: timestamp, URL, and referrer.

### Delta

The percentage change between the current period and the comparison period. Shown as a positive or negative value with color coding (green for improvement, red for decline). See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#delta-δ).

### Device Type

The category of device used to access your site: Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet. See the [Devices report](/reports/devices).

### Direct Traffic

Visits with no referrer or UTM parameters, typically from users typing the URL directly or using bookmarks. Shown as `(direct)` / `(none)` in source reports.

### Drop-off Rate

In a funnel, the percentage of users who left at a specific step without proceeding further. See [Funnel report](/reports/funnel).

---

## E

### E-commerce Tracking

Collection of revenue, transactions, and purchase events. SealMetrics supports full e-commerce analytics without cookies. See [E-commerce Conversion Tracking](/implementation/ecommerce-conversion-tracking).

### Engaged Entrances

Sessions where the visitor viewed more than one page (two or more pageviews). A measure of traffic quality. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#engaged-entrances).

### Engagement Rate

The percentage of sessions where visitors viewed more than one page. The inverse of Bounce Rate (Engagement Rate + Bounce Rate = 100%). See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#engagement-rate).

### Entrances

The number of sessions (visits) that started during the selected period. Each new session after 30 minutes of inactivity counts as one entrance. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#entrances).

### Event Tracking

Capturing specific user actions such as clicks, form submissions, scroll depth, or video plays. See [Event Tracking guide](/implementation/event-tracking).

---

## F

### Fingerprinting

Identifying a user through a combination of device attributes (screen size, fonts, plugins, etc.). SealMetrics does not perform fingerprinting.

### First-Party Tracker

A tracker running under your own domain (e.g., `analytics.yourdomain.com`) to avoid browser restrictions and ad blockers. See [Tracking Methods](/implementation/tracking-methods).

### Funnel

A defined sequence of steps a user is expected to follow (e.g., Product Page, Add to Cart, Checkout, Purchase). See [Funnel report](/reports/funnel).

### Funnel Completion Rate

The percentage of users who completed all steps in a funnel, from first step to last. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#funnel-completion-rate).

---

## G

### GDPR

General Data Protection Regulation -- the EU regulation governing the processing of personal data. SealMetrics is compliant because it does not collect personal data and does not require consent banners.

---

## H

### Hit

A single interaction recorded by SealMetrics: a pageview, event, or conversion. SealMetrics is a hit-based system, meaning each interaction is recorded independently.

---

## I

### Isolated Hits Tracking

A tracking method where each hit is recorded independently with no link between visits. This is the core of SealMetrics' privacy-first design. See [Consentless Analytics FAQ](/faq/consentless-analytics).

---

## L

### Landing Page

The first page a user views when starting a session. Analyzing landing page performance helps optimize first impressions and reduce bounce rates. See the [Pages report](/reports/pages).

### LENS

SealMetrics' AI-powered analytics insights engine. LENS analyzes your data and surfaces anomalies, trends, and actionable recommendations automatically. See [LENS documentation](/lens).

---

## M

### Microconversion

A small user interaction tracked as an event, such as scroll depth reached, button clicks, form starts, add-to-cart actions, or video plays. Tracked with `sealmetrics.micro()`. Useful for measuring funnel progression before a full conversion. See [Event Tracking guide](/implementation/event-tracking).

---

## O

### Operating System

The operating system of the visitor's device (e.g., Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux). Reported under the [Devices report](/reports/devices).

### Organization

The top-level entity in SealMetrics that contains Sites and Members. Organizations provide multi-user access control with roles (Owner, Admin, Member). See [Organizations API](/api/organizations).

---

## P

### Page Path

The URL path of a page, excluding the domain. For example, for `https://example.com/products/widget`, the path is `/products/widget`.

### Page Title

The HTML title of a page, taken from the `<title>` tag at the time of the pageview.

### Pageviews

The total number of pages viewed during the selected period. Each page load (including refreshes) counts as one pageview. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#pageviews).

### Pages per Session

The average number of pages viewed per session. Calculated as Total Pageviews divided by Total Entrances. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#pages-per-session).

### PECR

UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations -- restricts the use of cookies and similar technologies. SealMetrics is compliant because it stores nothing on user devices.

### Personal Data

Any information that can identify an individual, directly or indirectly. SealMetrics collects none.

### Privacy by Design

The principle of building systems that inherently protect user privacy from the ground up, rather than adding protections as an afterthought. SealMetrics follows this approach fully.

---

## R

### Referrer

The domain of the website that linked to your site, detected from the HTTP Referer header. Used for source attribution when no UTM parameters are present.

### Revenue

The total monetary value from conversions during the selected period, derived from the amount passed to `sealmetrics.conv()`. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#revenue).

### Revenue per Entrance

The average revenue generated per session. Calculated as Total Revenue divided by Total Entrances. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#revenue-per-entrance).

### Revenue per Visitor

The average revenue generated per unique visitor. Calculated as Total Revenue divided by Unique Visitors. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#revenue-per-visitor).

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

Revenue generated per unit of advertising spend. A ROAS above 1.0 means revenue exceeds cost. Requires external cost data import. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#return-on-ad-spend-roas).

---

## S

### Session

A group of interactions within a period of activity. In SealMetrics, a new session starts after 30 minutes of inactivity. SealMetrics uses session-level aggregation for metrics like Bounce Rate while keeping the tracking itself consentless.

### Session-ID Tracking

A temporary identifier used for the duration of a single pageview group. It is not persistent or linkable across visits, making it consent-free and compliant.

### Site

A website being tracked by SealMetrics. Each Site has a unique Site ID used in the tracking code. Sites belong to an Organization. See [Sites API](/api/sites).

### Source-ID Technology

SealMetrics technology that allows assigning conversions to traffic sources without identifying individual users.

### Step Completion Rate

In a funnel, the percentage of users who completed a step relative to the number who entered that step from the previous one. See [Funnel report](/reports/funnel).

---

## U

### Unique Visitors

The number of distinct users who visited during the selected period. Identified using cookieless methods; the same user on different devices counts as different visitors. See [Metrics Reference](/reports/definitions#unique-visitors).

### UTM Parameters

Standard URL parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_term`, `utm_content`) used to tag marketing links and identify traffic sources. Fully supported by SealMetrics without cookies. See [Sources report](/reports/sources).
