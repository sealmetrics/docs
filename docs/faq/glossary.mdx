# Technical Glossary

This glossary provides clear definitions of all key terms used throughout Sealmetrics documentation and FAQ sections.  
It helps you understand tracking behavior, privacy constraints, and analytics concepts behind cookieless measurement.

---

## **A — Analytics & Tracking**

### **Attribution**
The method used to assign a conversion to a traffic source.  
Sealmetrics uses *last-click attribution*, the only consentless-compliant model.

### **Aggregated Data**
Data that cannot be linked to individuals.  
Sealmetrics processes pageviews (“hits”) independently without reconstructing sessions.

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**
A programmatic interface used to extract analytics data, automate workflows, or integrate Sealmetrics with BI tools.

---

## **C — Consent, Cookies & Compliance**

### **CCPA**
California Consumer Privacy Act — regulates collection of personal data in California.  
Sealmetrics is compliant because it collects no personal data.

### **Consent Mode**
Google’s mechanism for restricting tracking based on user consent.  
Sealmetrics does not use Consent Mode and must not be blocked by it.

### **Cookies**
Small files stored on a user’s device to identify them across sessions.  
Sealmetrics uses **zero cookies**.

### **Cookieless Tracking**
Analytics without cookies, fingerprinting, or persistent identifiers.  
Sealmetrics tracks isolated hits while remaining compliant with GDPR and ePrivacy.

### **CNIL / AEPD**
French and Spanish data protection authorities whose guidelines define how analytics can operate without consent.  
Sealmetrics follows both strictly.

---

## **D — Data & Metrics**

### **Direct Traffic**
Visits without a referrer.  
Often inflated in GA4 because mid-session consent acceptance resets attribution.

### **Data Minimization**
Collecting only what is strictly necessary.  
Sealmetrics collects **4 variables per hit**: timestamp, user agent (not stored), URL, referrer.

---

## **E — E-commerce & Events**

### **Event Tracking**
Capturing specific user actions such as clicks, form submissions, or purchases.

### **E-commerce Tracking**
Collection of revenue, transactions, and purchase events.  
Sealmetrics supports full e-commerce analytics without cookies.

---

## **F — Fingerprinting & Privacy**

### **Fingerprinting**
Identifying a user through a combination of device attributes.  
Sealmetrics does *not* perform fingerprinting.

### **First-Party Tracker**
A tracker running under your own domain (e.g., `analytics.yourdomain.com`) to avoid browser restrictions.

---

## **H — Hits vs Sessions**

### **Hit**
A single interaction: pageview, event, or conversion.  
Sealmetrics is a **hit-based system**, not session-based.

### **Session**
A group of interactions in a period of time (e.g., 30 minutes).  
Sessions count as personal data → require consent → Sealmetrics does not track them.

---

## **P — Privacy & Regulations**

### **Privacy by Design**
Principle of designing systems that inherently protect user privacy.  
Sealmetrics follows this fully.

### **PECR**
UK’s Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations — restrict the use of cookies.  
Sealmetrics is compliant because it stores nothing on user devices.

### **Personal Data**
Anything that can identify an individual.  
Sealmetrics collects none.

---

## **R — ROAS & Reporting**

### **ROAS**
Return on Ad Spend.  
Sealmetrics calculates ROAS when cost and revenue tracking is enabled.

### **Referral**
The URL from which the user came.  
Used for source/medium attribution.

---

## **S — Sealmetrics Technology**

### **Session-ID Tracking**
Temporary ID for the duration of a single pageview group, not persistent or linkable.  
Consent-free and compliant.

### **Isolated Hits Tracking**
Each hit is recorded independently with no link between visits.  
Core of Sealmetrics' privacy-first design.

### **Source-ID Technology**
Allows assigning conversions to traffic sources without identifying users.

---

## **U — UTM Parameters**

### **UTM Source / Medium / Campaign / Term**
Standard marketing parameters defining how traffic arrives.  
Fully supported by Sealmetrics without cookies.
