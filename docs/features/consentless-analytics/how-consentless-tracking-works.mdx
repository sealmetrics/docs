# How Consentless Tracking Works

Consentless tracking represents a fundamental evolution in web analytics:  
shifting from **individual user tracking** to **aggregate, privacy-preserving measurement**.

Sealmetrics pioneered this approach through dual tracking technologies designed to capture complete website behavior **without personal data, without cookies, and without requiring user consent**.

---

# 1. The Core Methodology  
## Aggregate Measurement Instead of Individual Tracking

### Traditional Analytics (❌ Requires Consent)
- Uses cookies to store visitor IDs  
- Reconstructs individual user journeys  
- Builds detailed behavioral profiles  
- Tracks users across sessions  
- Loses **50–85%** of data when users decline cookies  

### Sealmetrics Consentless Approach (✅ No Consent Required)
- Measures **isolated, aggregate events**, not people  
- No cookies, no fingerprinting, no local storage  
- No user identification or profiling  
- 100% traffic capture — every hit is measured  
- Fully compliant with GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, PECR  

---

# 2. Dual Consentless Tracking System  
## The Only System in the World with Two Privacy-Preserving Measurement Modes

Sealmetrics combines two tracking techniques to offer flexibility based on privacy needs.

---

## **A. Session-ID Based Tracking**  
### How It Works
- Generates a **temporary, session-limited ID**  
- ID expires as soon as the session ends  
- No cross-session linking  
- No persistent identifiers  

### Data Captured
- Page views for the duration of the session  
- Events happening in the same visit  

### Privacy Safeguards
- No user-level profiles  
- No personal data collected  
- Session IDs cannot identify individuals  
- Immediate anonymization at point of capture  

---

## **B. Isolated Hits Tracking (SuperPrivacy Mode)**  
### How It Works
- Every interaction = a **fully isolated hit**  
- No linking between hits  
- No session reconstruction  
- No behavioral pattern building  

### Why It’s the Most Private Method
- No correlation = no possibility of identifying a person  
- Ideal for strict privacy environments (e.g., healthcare, government)  
- Fastest processing due to ultra-minimal dataset  

---

# 3. The Four-Variable System  
## Sealmetrics Only Captures These Four Anonymous Variables

Each hit includes:

1. **Timestamp**  
2. **User Agent** *(captured but NOT stored)*  
3. **Current URL**  
4. **Referral URL**

Nothing more.

This extremely minimal dataset makes personal identification technically impossible.

# 4. How Data Is Collected and Processed  
## Technical Flow of Consentless Tracking

### Step 1 — Event Detection
- JavaScript tracker detects page views or events  
- No cookies, local storage, or fingerprinting  
- Immediate anonymization  

### Step 2 — Processing Layer
- Events processed through privacy-preserving algorithms  
- Patterns aggregated statistically  
- No cross-hit linking  

### Step 3 — Insight Generation
- Dashboards and reports show aggregate behavior  
- No user journeys  
- No personal data, ever  

---

# 5. The “Ping” Methodology  
Sealmetrics uses a privacy-safe request system similar to search engines’ crawlers.

### Traditional Analytics “Pings”  
❌ Associated with user identifiers  
❌ Require consent  
❌ Build behavioral profiles  

### Sealmetrics Privacy Pings  
✅ Fully anonymous  
✅ No consent required  
✅ Used only to understand aggregate behavior  

---

# 6. Tracker Options  
## Choose the Privacy Model That Fits Your Needs

### **GlobalTracker (Recommended for 98% of websites)**  
- Follows hit sequence within a single session  
- Offers session-level behavior insights  
- No user identification  
- Ideal for e-commerce and marketing teams  

### **SuperPrivacy Tracker (Maximum Anonymity)**  
- Each hit completely independent  
- No session logic  
- Zero correlation possible  
- Ideal for healthcare, government, finance  

---

# 7. Privacy-Safe Attribution  
## How Conversions Are Attributed Without Tracking People

Sealmetrics uses:

- **Last-click attribution**
- **UTM parameter processing**
- **Anonymous channel assignment**

Conversions are linked to channels — **not to individuals**.

---

# 8. Compliance by Design  
## Why Sealmetrics Doesn’t Require Consent

### GDPR
- No personal data → GDPR does not apply  
- No identifiers, no profiles, no tracking of individuals  

### ePrivacy Directive
- No cookies  
- No local storage  
- No access to terminal equipment  

### CCPA / PECR
- No personal information  
- No sale or sharing of user-level data  

### European Infrastructure
- 100% hosted in Dublin (Ireland)  
- No international data transfers  

This is **privacy-by-design**, not privacy-by-policy.

# 9. Real-World Implementation Example

```html
<!-- Basic Sealmetrics Implementation -->
<script>
(function() {
  var options = {
    account: 'ADD-ACCOUNT-ID',
    event: 'pageview',
    use_session: 1
  };
  var url = "//app.sealmetrics.com/tag/v2/tracker";
  function loadScript(callback) {
    var script = document.createElement("script");
    script.src = url;
    script.async = true;
    script.onload = function() { callback && callback(); };
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  }
  loadScript(function() {
    options.id = Math.floor((Math.random() * 999) + 1);
    if (window.sm) {
      new window.sm(options).track(options.event);
    }
  });
})();
</script>
