# Understanding Event Properties in Sealmetrics

Event Properties in Sealmetrics are customizable **key-value pairs** that you can attach to any conversion or micro-conversion event. They enrich events with additional metadata, enabling deeper segmentation, more granular reporting, and more powerful business insights.

---

## What Are Event Properties?

Event properties extend the standard conversion payload with information such as:

- Event metadata  
- Product or service context  
- Commercial attributes  
- Custom business logic  
- Any custom dimensions required  

---

## How Properties Work

By default, Sealmetrics tracks:

- Event type  
- Event label  
- Basic contextual information  

Event Properties expand this with custom dimensions.

```js
properties: {
  'custom-name-1': 'value-1',
  'custom-name-2': 'value-2',
  'product-id': '12345',
  'price': '99.99',
  'category': 'electronics'
}
```

## Benefits of Using Properties

### **1. Richer Analytics**
Capture more detailed context for every conversion.

### **2. Better Segmentation**
Filter and group reports based on property values.

### **3. Marketing Attribution**
Attach business-relevant parameters to understand conversion variations.

### **4. Business-Specific Metrics**
Adapt analytics to your product, business model or reporting needs.
