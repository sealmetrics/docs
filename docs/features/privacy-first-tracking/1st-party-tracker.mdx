# 1st Party Tracker

The 1st-party tracker by Sealmetrics is a cookie-free, privacy-first tracking solution designed to ensure accurate measurement without storing anything on the user’s device. Like the previous tracking pixels, this solution also uses a pixel-based approach. However, instead of operating from the standard URL (e.g., app.sealmetrics.com), the tracker is set to function from a subdomain linked to your website, such as random-numbers.yourdomain.com. 

Using a 1st-party subdomain, Sealmetrics can bypass ad blockers, allowing you to collect accurate data seamlessly and respecting user privacy. This approach provides a robust, resilient measurement solution for privacy-conscious and ad-blocking audiences.

## How It Works
- The pixel loads from a subdomain you host.
- Browsers treat it as part of your own website.
- No cookies, no fingerprinting, no identifiers.
- Fully GDPR/ePrivacy compliant.

## Benefits
- Avoids ad blockers  
- Accurate metrics  
- Fully privacy-preserving
