# How Attribution Works Without a User-ID

Sealmetrics delivers accurate campaign and conversion attribution without using User-IDs, cookies, fingerprinting, or session reconstruction. This article explains the mechanism behind our privacy-preserving attribution system.

## Why Traditional Analytics Require User-IDs

Conventional analytics platforms depend on identifiers to track user journeys:

- Cookie IDs  
- Device IDs  
- Fingerprints  
- Cross-session identifiers  

These technologies **link visits, clicks, and conversions to individuals**, which legally requires consent under GDPR and ePrivacy.

Sealmetrics does **not** use any of these identifiers.

## Sealmetrics' Privacy-First Approach

Sealmetrics does **not**:

❌ Track users  
❌ Link page views  
❌ Build sessions  
❌ Store IP addresses  
❌ Store user agents  
❌ Use cookies or persistent identifiers  

Each interaction (hit) is completely isolated and cannot be associated with an individual.

---

## The Key Innovation — The Source-ID

Instead of identifying users, Sealmetrics groups traffic and conversions using a **Source-ID**, derived exclusively from **traffic source characteristics**, not from user behavior.

### A Source-ID is generated from:

- `utm_source`
- `utm_medium`
- `utm_campaign`
- `utm_term`
- OR the referring domain

No personal data. No unique identifiers.

### How It Works

1. A visitor lands on the site from a marketing source  
2. Sealmetrics reads the traffic parameters  
3. A **Source-ID** is generated from those parameters  
4. All hits with the same campaign parameters share the same Source-ID  
5. Conversions inherit the same Source-ID  

This groups interactions by **campaign**, not by user.

---

## Example — Attribution in Action

### 🔵 Step 1: User clicks a Google Ads campaign  
UTM parameters detected → Source-ID created.

### 🟣 Step 2: They browse the site  
Hits remain isolated but carry the same Source-ID.

### 🟢 Step 3: They convert  
The conversion is assigned to the same Source-ID.

### Result  
**Conversion is attributed to Google Ads → Campaign XYZ → Keyword ABC.**

No user identification required.

## Why This Is Fully Privacy-Compliant

This method complies with GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, PECR:

- ✔ No personal data  
- ✔ No user identification  
- ✔ No behavioral profiling  
- ✔ No cross-session linkage  
- ✔ No consent required  

Privacy protection is embedded by design.
