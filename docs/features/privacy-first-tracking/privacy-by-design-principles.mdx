# Privacy by Design Principles

At Sealmetrics, privacy is not an add-on — it is the foundation of the platform.  
We don’t simply comply with privacy regulations; we exceed them through strict technical choices, architectural constraints, and a philosophy that prioritizes user privacy over data collection.

This document explains the seven core Privacy-by-Design principles and how Sealmetrics implements each of them.

---

# 1. Proactive, Not Reactive  
## Anticipating privacy risks before they arise

**Core idea:** Prevent privacy issues instead of responding to them.

### Sealmetrics Implementation
- Privacy safeguards embedded deeply into the architecture  
- Designed with future regulations in mind, not just current ones  
- Continuous privacy impact assessments  
- Preventive system design to avoid risk  

### Practical Examples
- Sealmetrics’ dual tracking system was implemented *before* consentless analytics became a regulatory topic  
- Early legal consultation during development  
- Architecture designed for future restrictions (GDPR evolution, ePrivacy, PECR updates)

---

# 2. Privacy as the Default Setting  
## Maximum privacy without requiring user action

**Core idea:** Users should be protected automatically.

### Sealmetrics Implementation
- No opt-in required for privacy  
- Anonymous tracking by default  
- No personal data collection  
- No cookies  
- Privacy protection enabled from first page load  

### Technical Architecture
- Zero personal data  
- No persistent identifiers  
- No browser storage  
- Anonymous processing at first touch

- Strict internal access controls  
- Complete audit trails  

### Infrastructure

- Each hit processed independently  
- No user-level tracking  
- No reconstruction of journeys  
- No storage of user agent strings  

### Architecture

# 7. Accommodate All Legitimate Interests  
## Balance privacy, analytics needs, and legal obligations

### What Businesses Get
- Complete performance analytics  
- Conversion and revenue tracking  
- Marketing attribution  
- Funnel and behavioral insights  

### What Users Get
- Total anonymity  
- No tracking identifiers  
- No privacy trade-offs  
- No consent banners

# Technical Implementation of Privacy by Design

## The Four-Variable Architecture
Sealmetrics tracks only:  
1. **Timestamp**  
2. **User agent** (captured, not stored)  
3. **Current URL**  
4. **Referral URL**

This minimal dataset ensures functionality without compromising privacy.

---

## European Infrastructure
- All processing in Dublin (Ireland)  
- No international transfers  
- Controlled under EU privacy law  
- Regular oversight and auditability  

---

## Isolated Hits Methodology
- No correlation between hits  
- No user-level stitching  
- No session reconstruction  
- No behavioral profiling  
- Personal identification is technically impossible
