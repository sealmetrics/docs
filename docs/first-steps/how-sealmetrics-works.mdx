# How Sealmetrics Works

## Does Sealmetrics prioritize KPIs over legality?

Not at all. Sealmetrics takes privacy a step further.  
We don’t track **anything** that could compromise user privacy.  

If tracking a particular KPI would violate users’ rights, **we don’t track it** — even if regulations technically allow it.

This principle ensures our technology remains privacy-first, not performance-first.

## What is Sealmetrics’ privacy policy?

Our stance has been clear from the very beginning:  
For us, **privacy is not just a policy — it’s a philosophy.**

Many of our team members are marketers. When we built Sealmetrics, we wanted a web analytics platform that:

- Respects both **user** and **company** privacy  
- Remains **effective** for data-driven decisions  
- Avoids any **identifiable** data collection  

We intentionally apply **stricter privacy standards** than some regulations require.  
This guarantees that users, professionals, and companies can rely on Sealmetrics as a **fully compliant, ethical analytics solution**.

## What regulations does Sealmetrics follow?

Before developing Sealmetrics, we consulted with **privacy lawyers and data protection specialists** to ensure long-term compliance and resilience against future privacy laws.

Sealmetrics fully aligns with the principles of:

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **ePrivacy Directive**
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- **PECR** (Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations)
- Any **upcoming privacy frameworks** with similar goals

All these frameworks share a core objective — **protecting citizens’ privacy as a fundamental human right**.

## What Sealmetrics Doesn’t Do

Sealmetrics **does not** track individual journeys or personal activities.  
Our system is designed so that **no data can ever be linked to a specific person.**

That means:

- No personal identifiers  
- No user profiles  
- No behavioral tracking  
- No data re-identification possible  

Sealmetrics delivers meaningful, aggregated analytics — **without ever compromising privacy.**
