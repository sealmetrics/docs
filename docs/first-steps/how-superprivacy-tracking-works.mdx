# How SuperPrivacy Tracking Works

Sealmetrics focuses on key information to generate valuable reports for marketers, aiding in decision-making.  
The data points we consider include:

- **Common user agent**
- **Timestamp**
- **URL**
- **Referral URL**

Sealmetrics tracks **hits** rather than individual journeys or paths, ensuring compliance with the **ePrivacy Directive**.  
For example, if 25 people are on your site, Sealmetrics tracks how visitors navigate your site — but only in an **aggregated** and **anonymous** way.

## Tracking Setup

Sealmetrics works with a small **JavaScript snippet** embedded into your website.

### Pageview Tracker Code

```html
<script>
  /* Sealmetrics Tracker Code */
  var oSm = window.oSm || {};
  oSm.account = '000000000000000000001234';
  oSm.event = 'pageview';
  oSm.decore = 1;

  !function(e){
    var t="//app.sealmetrics.com/tag/tracker";
    window.oSm=oSm,
    window.smTrackerLoaded
      ? sm.tracker.track(e.event)
      : Promise.all([
          new Promise(function(e){
            var n=document.createElement("script");
            n.src=t,n.async=!0,n.onload=function(){e(t)},
            document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(n)
          })
        ]).then(function(){sm.tracker.track(e.event)})
  }(oSm);
  /* End Sealmetrics Tracker Code */
</script>

This pixel must be added to all your pages.

## Event Tracker Code

You can add an event code to track micro conversions and conversions.

<script>
  /* Sealmetrics Event Tracker */
  var oSm = window.oSm || {};
  oSm.decore = 1;
  oSm.event = 'conversion';

  !function(e){
    var t = "//app.sealmetrics.com/tag/tracker";
    window.oSm = oSm;
    if (window.smTrackerLoaded) {
      sm.tracker.track(e.event);
    } else {
      Promise.all([
        new Promise(function(resolve) {
          var n = document.createElement("script");
          n.src = t;
          n.async = true;
          n.onload = function() { resolve(t); };
          document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(n);
        })
      ]).then(function() {
        sm.tracker.track(e.event);
      });
    }
  }(oSm);
  /* End Sealmetrics Event Tracker */
</script>

You can include additional parameters following the setup wizard — always respecting privacy regulations.
Real-Time Tracking

Once the pixels are implemented, Sealmetrics starts tracking in real-time.
	•	Every page view is counted in aggregate form
	•	No individual or anonymized journeys are recorded
	•	Only page views (“hits”) are measured



## Why Clients Choose Sealmetrics

After analyzing feedback from our customers, here’s what they value most:
	•	100% of traffic, conversions, and revenue are tracked
	•	Full visibility by source, medium, campaign, and term
	•	No user tracking, yet accurate attribution through our Source-ID technology

This system assigns conversions to the correct traffic sources while maintaining GDPR and ePrivacy compliance.


## Strictly Legal Tech

Sealmetrics clients want to avoid legal or future legal issues.
That’s why Sealmetrics is built to be fully compliant with current regulations and anticipate future privacy directives.

When a conversion occurs, the conversion pixel is triggered automatically, ensuring each event is counted precisely — without compromising user privacy.
