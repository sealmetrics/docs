# How to Measure Conversions and Micro-Conversions

With Sealmetrics, you have full control over measuring conversions and micro-conversions — ensuring accurate data collection while avoiding unnecessary duplication of pageviews.

Each conversion or micro-conversion event must be linked to a pageview, but you can define whether that pageview is triggered automatically or managed manually.

This guide explains how to configure your pixel for multiple use cases.

---

## Key Configuration Options

1. **Automatic Pageview Triggering:**  
   By default, the new pixel includes a pageview alongside any conversion or micro-conversion.

2. **Exclude Pageviews from the Conversion Pixel:**  
   You can avoid triggering an additional pageview by adding a `ignore_pageview: 1` parameter.

3. **Flexible Event Tracking:**  
   Customize your tracking setup to fit your needs while maintaining data accuracy.

## Use Cases

### 1. Tracking a Button Click (Avoiding Duplicate Pageviews)

If you’re measuring an event like a button click on a page where the pageview has already been logged, you should **disable the pageview** on the conversion pixel.  
This prevents double counting in the same session.

```html
<script>
  /* Sealmetrics Tracker Code */
  var oSm = window.oSm || {};
  oSm.account = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID";
  oSm.event = "conversion";
  oSm.ignore_pageview = 1;

  !(function (e) {
    var t = "//app.sealmetrics.com/tag/tracker";
    window.oSm = oSm;
    if (window.smTrackerLoaded) sm.tracker.track(e.event);
    else
      Promise.all([
        new Promise(function (e) {
          var n = document.createElement("script");
          n.src = t;
          n.async = !0;
          n.onload = function () {
            e(t);
          };
          document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(n);
        }),
      ]).then(function () {
        sm.tracker.track(e.event);
      });
  })(oSm);
</script>

### 2. Tracking a Conversion (Including Pageview)

If you need to include a pageview when tracking a conversion (e.g., a purchase confirmation page), simply omit the ignore_pageview parameter.
This ensures both the pageview and conversion are tracked accurately.

<script>
  /* Sealmetrics Tracker Code */
  var oSm = window.oSm || {};
  oSm.account = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID";
  oSm.event = "conversion";

  !(function (e) {
    var t = "//app.sealmetrics.com/tag/tracker";
    window.oSm = oSm;
    if (window.smTrackerLoaded) sm.tracker.track(e.event);
    else
      Promise.all([
        new Promise(function (e) {
          var n = document.createElement("script");
          n.src = t;
          n.async = !0;
          n.onload = function () {
            e(t);
          };
          document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(n);
        }),
      ]).then(function () {
        sm.tracker.track(e.event);
      });
  })(oSm);
</script>

How It Works

Default Behavior:
The new pixel automatically tracks a pageview alongside any conversion or micro-conversion.

Customizable Behavior:
You can prevent the pageview from being triggered by adding ignore_pageview: 1 in the configuration.

Best Practices
	1.	Avoid Duplicate Pageviews:
When tracking events (like a button click) on a page where the pageview has already been logged, use the ignore_pageview parameter.
	2.	Ensure Every Conversion Has a Pageview:
Every conversion or micro-conversion needs to be associated with a pageview.
If you exclude the pageview from the conversion pixel, ensure it has already been triggered elsewhere in your setup.

Where to Find Event Pixels

You can view and manage your event pixels directly in your Sealmetrics account under Settings → Tags & API Info → Event Pixels.
