The **Acquisition Sources Report** in SealMetrics provides an in-depth view of your **traffic sources** and how each marketing channel performs.

---

## 📊 Overview

The report displays:

- **Source** and **Medium**
- **Entrances** and **Page views**
- **Conversions** and **Micro-conversions**
- **Conversion rate**
- **Revenue** and **Cost**
- **ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend) — if the **cost calculator** is enabled

This comprehensive view allows marketers to quickly understand which channels deliver the most value and where optimization opportunities exist.

---

## 💰 Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

When both **cost** and **revenue** data are available, SealMetrics automatically calculates **ROAS**, helping you determine which campaigns and sources provide the highest financial return.

> Example: A campaign that generates €500 in revenue with a cost of €100 achieves a ROAS of **5x**.

This calculation allows teams to prioritize the channels that truly drive profitability.

---

## 🔍 Filtering and Deep Analysis

You can refine the acquisition report by applying filters such as:

- **Medium**
- **Campaign**
- **Term**
- **Device**
- **Operating system**

Filtering allows deeper insights into the effectiveness of each campaign or traffic source.

## 🧠 Insight Example

Using this approach, SealMetrics enables users to identify, for example, **which operating system yields the best results** for marketing campaigns.

This level of detail empowers data-driven decision-making and helps allocate resources to the most effective acquisition sources.
