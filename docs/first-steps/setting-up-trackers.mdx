# Setting Up Trackers in Sealmetrics

To ensure accurate data collection with Sealmetrics, you can easily set up different trackers for your site.  
This guide walks you through configuring your **global** and **conversion** trackers step by step.

## Step 1: Accessing the Tracker Configuration

1. Log in to your [Sealmetrics Dashboard](https://app.sealmetrics.com).  
2. Navigate to **Tags & API Info → Common Tracker**.  
3. Here you can manage your tracking setup, including installations, pages, events, conversions, and micro-conversions.

---

## Step 2: Accessing Tags & Connectors

1. Open **Settings → Tags & Connectors**.  
2. Under **Integration Options**, you can assign IDs.  
3. If you manage multiple domains, each one will have its own **Tracking ID**.

## Step 3: Choosing Your Tracker Type

Under **Tags & Connectors → New Tag & Connectors**, you’ll find a list of available tracker types:

- **Global Tracker (Main Tag):**  
  The standard tracking method suitable for overall traffic monitoring.

- **Conversion Tracker (Sales Tag):**  
  Used to track conversions, revenue, and micro-conversions.

- **Event Tracker (Micro-Event Tag):**  
  Measures user interactions such as button clicks or scrolls.

Each tracker type serves a specific purpose and should be implemented based on your measurement goals.  
For instance, use the **Conversion Tracker** to count purchases or sign-ups, and the **Event Tracker** for smaller actions like clicks or interactions.

## Step 4: Go to Global Tracker

1. Click **Global Tracker** in your Sealmetrics dashboard.  
2. Copy the tracker code displayed on the screen.  
3. Paste the code inside the `<head>` tag of every page on your website.

## Step 5: Set Up Conversion Pixel

1. Go to **Conversion Pixel** in the Sealmetrics dashboard.  
2. Select **Conversion**.  
3. Introduce a name for your conversion or micro-conversion.  
4. If the conversion has a value, add it to the **Value** field.  
5. Use the **ignore page view?** option when a pageview should not be counted for that event.  
6. Save your changes.

### Understanding the “Ignore Page View” Option

The **ignore page view** setting allows you to skip counting an additional pageview when a conversion is triggered on an already tracked page.

**Example:**  
If a user clicks “Buy Now” on a product page that has already been logged as a pageview, enabling `ignore_pageview = 1` avoids double counting.

## Step 6: Triggering the Pixel in Tag Manager

If you use **Google Tag Manager**, place the conversion pixel in the “All Pages” tag or create a custom trigger when the conversion action occurs.

Example trigger:  
When a user reaches `/thank-you` after completing a purchase, the conversion pixel fires automatically.

## Step 7: Set Up the Sales Funnel (Optional)

1. Go to **Sales Funnel** under the Sealmetrics dashboard.  
2. Add your funnel steps manually.  
3. Configure events such as “Add to Cart”, “Checkout”, and “Purchase”.  
4. Save and test your funnel configuration.
