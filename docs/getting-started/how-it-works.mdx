# How Sealmetrics Works

Sealmetrics is built on a simple principle: **measure everything, identify no one**. Our privacy-first analytics platform captures 100% of your website traffic without cookies, consent banners, or personal data collection.

## The Challenge We Solve

Traditional analytics tools lose 60-87% of visitor data in EU markets because users reject cookies. That means you're making business decisions with incomplete information. Sealmetrics captures every visitor while staying fully compliant with GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, and PECR.

## The Four-Variable System

Every interaction on your website is captured using just four data points:

1. **Timestamp** - When the visit happened
2. **User Agent** - Browser and device type (detected but not stored)
3. **Current URL** - Which page was viewed
4. **Referral URL** - Where the visitor came from

That's it. No IP addresses, no cookies, no persistent identifiers. This minimal approach makes it legally impossible to identify individual users while still giving you actionable insights.

## Two Tracking Modes for Different Needs

### GlobalTracker (Recommended for Most Sites)

Our default mode creates a temporary session ID that expires when the browser closes. This allows you to:

- Track page views within a single visit
- Measure session duration and engagement
- Follow navigation patterns through your site
- Identify conversion paths

The session ID is isolated to that one visit and can never be used to identify the person or link visits together.

### SuperPrivacy Mode (Maximum Anonymity)

For healthcare, government, or sensitive applications, SuperPrivacy mode treats every page view as a completely isolated event:

- Zero linking between any interactions
- No session reconstruction possible
- Maximum privacy with aggregate insights only
- Ideal for strict regulatory environments

## How Data Flows Through Sealmetrics

**Step 1: Event Detection**
A lightweight JavaScript snippet on your website detects page views and events. The script is asynchronous and won't slow down your site.

**Step 2: Instant Anonymization**
Data is immediately anonymized at the collection layer. User agents are parsed for insights but never stored. No IP addresses are captured at any point in the system.

**Step 3: Secure Processing**
All data is processed on EU-based servers in Dublin, Ireland. We use encryption in transit and at rest, with strict access controls and complete audit trails.

**Step 4: Aggregate Insights**
Your dashboard shows statistical patterns across all visitors. You see traffic sources, popular pages, conversion rates, and revenue attribution—all without tracking individuals.

## Attribution Without Personal Data

Sealmetrics uses **last-click attribution** at the channel level. When someone converts, we attribute that conversion to the traffic source (like "Google Organic" or "Facebook Ads") without connecting it to any individual person.

This gives you the marketing intelligence you need—which channels drive results—without the privacy risks of user-level tracking.

## Real-Time Visibility

See live visitors on your site right now. Monitor conversion events as they happen. Verify your tracking implementation instantly. All in real-time, without compromising anyone's privacy.

## Integration Made Simple

Getting started takes two minutes:

1. Add one script tag to your website's `<head>` section
2. Start seeing data immediately
3. Configure goals and events as needed

Works with any framework: WordPress, React, Vue, standard HTML. Use our native plugins or integrate via Google Tag Manager.

## Bot Filtering

We automatically filter out known bots, scrapers, and monitoring tools so you only see real human visitors. Our system recognizes search engine crawlers, uptime monitors, and datacenter traffic.

## API Access for Custom Needs

Need to pull data into your own systems? Our REST API gives you programmatic access to all your analytics data. Export to CSV, build custom dashboards, or integrate with your existing tools.

## The Result: Complete Data, Zero Compromise

- **5-8x more complete data** than cookie-based analytics in EU markets
- **Zero consent requirements** - no banners, no data loss
- **Fully compliant** - GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, PECR by design
- **Always accurate** - no ad blocker interference
- **EU infrastructure only** - all servers in Dublin, Ireland

Sealmetrics proves you don't need to track people to understand your traffic. You just need to measure the right things, the right way.
