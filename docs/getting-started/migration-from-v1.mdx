# Migrate from Sealmetrics v1

If you're upgrading from Sealmetrics v1, the Migration Wizard lets you import your historical data into your new v2 account. The process runs in the background and typically takes a few minutes depending on the amount of data.

## What gets migrated

| Data type | Migrated | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Conversions | Yes | E-commerce transactions and goals |
| Microconversions | Yes | Custom events and interactions |
| Pageviews | No | Not available from v1 export format |

## How to migrate

### Step 1: Connect your v1 account

1. Go to **Settings → Migration**
2. Select your v2 destination account
3. Click **Start New Migration**
4. Enter your Sealmetrics v1 credentials (email, password, and v1 Account ID)
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify

### Step 2: Preview available data

The wizard automatically shows:
- Available date range from your v1 account
- You can select a custom date range if you don't want to import everything

### Step 3: Configure import

- Choose which data types to import (conversions, microconversions)
- Review the summary and click **Start Migration**

### Step 4: Monitor progress

- A progress bar shows real-time import status
- You can close the page — the migration continues in the background
- Return to **Settings → Migration** anytime to check progress

## Important notes

- Only one migration can run per account at a time
- Your v1 credentials are encrypted and only used during the import
- Imported data appears in your v2 reports immediately after migration completes
- You can cancel a running migration at any time

## Migration history

All past migrations are listed below the wizard with their status and details. You can view the progress of any running migration.
