# Quick Journey through the Platform

In this quick walkthrough of Sealmetrics, we explore its key features designed for efficient user and account management.

---

## User Management

Easily create, edit, and delete users.  
Assign roles, manage permissions, and determine access to specific accounts directly from the dashboard.

---

## Account Monitoring

Add or remove accounts effortlessly.  
You can also edit account details like **time zones**, **notification emails**, and **domain configurations** for each account.

---

## Referral Tracking

Track all referral sources and link them to specific **UTM sources**, **mediums**, or **campaigns**.  
This allows you to understand which channels are driving performance and conversions.

---

## Cost Calculator

The cost calculator helps manage paid media campaigns by assigning costs to different channels (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn).  
It enables real **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)** calculation per source and campaign.

---

## Conversion Synchronization

Easily sync conversions from advertising platforms like **Google Ads** and **Bing Ads**.  
Sealmetrics provides step-by-step guides for setup and synchronization.

> Note: Conversion synchronization requires the user's consent to comply with advertising platform policies.

---

## Pixel Implementation

Sealmetrics supports flexible tracking options:
- **Session-ID tracking** — measures sessions anonymously without cookies or consent.
- **Isolated hits tracking** — captures events independently for advanced analysis.

Pixels can be implemented directly in your website’s code or through **Google Tag Manager**.

---

## E-commerce Tracking

Easily track purchases and conversions, assigning **fixed** or **dynamic values** (e.g., product price or revenue).  
This enables full **conversion value** and **revenue analysis** across all sources and campaigns.

---

## User Profile Management

Manage your credentials, account type, and access permissions in the **My Profile** section.
