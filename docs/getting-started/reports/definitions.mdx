# Definitions

This page defines the core metrics and calculations used throughout SealMetrics reports.  
Understanding these terms ensures consistent interpretation of your analytics data.

---

## Entrances

**Definition:**  
An *Entrance* is a session that begins when a user visits your site with an **empty referrer** or a **referrer from a different domain**.

**How it works:**
- **Direct traffic:** When someone types your URL directly or uses a bookmark  
- **External referrals:** When someone clicks a link from another website  
- **Search engines:** When someone finds your site through search results  
- **Social media:** When someone clicks a link from social platforms  

**Example:**  
If a user arrives at your site from a Google search, that counts as **one entrance**.

---

## Pageview

**Definition:**  
The number of times a page has been viewed.

**Key points:**
- Each page load counts as one pageview  
- Multiple views by the same user count separately  
- Refreshing a page generates a new pageview  
- Useful for measuring content popularity and engagement  

**Example:**  
If 100 people visit your homepage and 50 refresh once, you'll record **150 pageviews**.

---

## Conversions

**Definition:**  
A *Conversion* occurs each time a user completes an action that you’ve marked as a goal.  
SealMetrics recommends using **purchases** as your main conversion.

**Best practices:**
- **Primary conversions:** Purchases, sign-ups, leads  
- **Focus on value:** Track actions that directly impact business outcomes  
- **Avoid over-tracking:** Don’t mark every minor action as a conversion  
- **Business relevance:** Choose goals tied to measurable revenue  

**Example:**  
An e-commerce site should track **completed purchases** as conversions — not just product page views.

---

## Revenue

**Definition:**  
The *Revenue* metric represents the total value of transactions captured by your conversion pixel.

**Revenue tracking includes:**
- **Purchase values:** Captures the value of each transaction  
- **Currency support:** Multi-currency compatible  
- **Attribution:** Revenue is attributed to the correct traffic sources  
- **Tax handling:** Configurable to include or exclude taxes  

**Example:**  
If a user buys a €50 and a €30 product, total revenue = **€80**.

---

## Micro Conversion

**Definition:**  
A *Micro Conversion* is a smaller user action that indicates engagement or intent, such as adding an item to the cart.

**Common micro conversions:**
- Add to cart  
- Newsletter sign-up  
- Video views  
- Form starts  
- File downloads  
- Account creation  

**Example:**  
When a visitor adds a product to the cart but doesn’t purchase, that’s a **micro conversion**.

---

## Cost

**Definition:**  
The total amount invested in marketing efforts.

**Cost components:**
- Advertising spend  
- Agency or management fees  
- Platform or software costs  
- Creative production expenses  

**Example:**  
If you spend €1,000 on Google Ads and €500 on Facebook Ads, your total cost = **€1,500**.

---

## Conversion Rate

**Definition:**  
The percentage of users who converted out of all entrances.

**Formula:**
Conversion Rate = (Conversions ÷ Entrances) × 100
**Example:**
- 1,000 entrances  
- 50 conversions  
- Conversion rate = (50 ÷ 1,000) × 100 = **5%**

---

## Conversion Type

**Definition:**  
The breakdown of conversions by type, as defined in your SealMetrics setup.

**Common conversion types:**
- Purchase (e-commerce)
- Lead (contact form)
- Signup (account registration)
- Download (resource)
- Subscription (newsletter or service)

Each type can be assigned a unique **business value**.

---

## Top Medium

**Definition:**  
The mediums driving the highest number of entrances and conversions (based on UTM reassignment).

**Common mediums:**
- Organic (SEO traffic)
- CPC (paid search)
- Social (social media)
- Email (email marketing)
- Referral (external websites)
- Direct (typed URLs)

---

## Top Sources

**Definition:**  
The main domains or sources from which your traffic originates.

**Examples:**
- Google (search engine)
- Facebook (social)
- LinkedIn (professional network)
- Newsletter (email)
- Partner sites (referral)

---

## Advanced Metrics

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

**Formula:**
ROAS = Revenue ÷ Cost
**Interpretation:**
- **ROAS > 3:1:** Highly profitable  
- **ROAS 2–3:1:** Acceptable  
- **ROAS < 2:1:** Underperforming  

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Not displayed directly in reports, but can be calculated using:

- Average order value  
- Purchase frequency  
- Customer retention rate  

This metric helps estimate long-term customer profitability.

---

### Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)

**Formula:**
CPA = Cost ÷ Conversions
**Example:**  
€1,000 cost with 50 conversions = **€20 CPA**

---

## Metric Relationships

### Funnel Path

Understanding how metrics connect in the user journey:
Entrances → Pageviews → Micro Conversions → Conversions → Revenue
