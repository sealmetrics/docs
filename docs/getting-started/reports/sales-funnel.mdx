With **SealMetrics**, you can easily create and analyze sales funnels based on **micro-conversions** and **events**.  
For example, a funnel might represent a user who adds a product to the cart, initiates checkout, and completes a purchase — giving you full visibility of your conversion journey.

---

## 📊 Funnel Overview

SealMetrics allows you to define funnel steps such as:

- Add to Cart  
- Checkout Initiation  
- Completed Sale  

Each stage can be **reordered dynamically**, and any changes you make automatically update both the **graph** and the **table** in real time.

This flexibility allows marketing teams to test hypotheses and visualize how users move through the funnel without needing developer input.

---

## 📈 Key Metrics Displayed

The **Sales Funnel Report** includes the following data points:

- **Traffic sources** and **entrances**  
- **Total conversions** and **micro-conversions**  
- **Add-to-cart** actions  
- **Checkouts** and **sales**  
- **Conversion rate** per stage  
- Optional filters for **medium**, **campaign**, **term**, **device**, **OS**, or **country**

These metrics can be segmented and compared to identify bottlenecks or high-performing segments.

---

## 🧮 Smart Button: Percentage View

A standout feature of this report is the **Smart Button**, which instantly converts all data into **percentages**.  
This mode helps you see, for example:

- What percentage of **entrances** resulted in an **add-to-cart**  
- What percentage of **cart additions** advanced to **checkout**  
- What percentage of **checkouts** turned into **sales**

By analyzing these drop-off rates, you can detect weak stages in your funnel.

> Example: If Facebook traffic shows strong add-to-cart rates but a sharp drop from checkout to sales, the issue likely lies in the checkout experience rather than acquisition.

---

## 🔍 Campaign-Level Insights

You can filter the funnel data by **campaign** to analyze individual channel performance.  
Each campaign view includes:

- **Color-coded growth indicators**:  
  - 🟩 Green for improvement  
  - 🟥 Red for decline  
- **Conversion rate per funnel stage**
- **Performance comparison across channels**

This enables you to detect underperforming campaigns quickly and reallocate budget efficiently.
