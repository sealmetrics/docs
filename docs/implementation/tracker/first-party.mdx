# First Party Tracker

## How 1st Party Tracking Works

### Why Install a First-Party Tracker Instead of a Third-Party Tracker?

By using our **first-party tracker**, you’ll be better protected against ad blockers.  
Ad blockers often block scripts from third-party domains. However, when you upgrade to a **first-party tracker**, ad blockers will recognize that the JavaScript is loaded from **your own domain** and, as a rule, it won’t be blocked.

To access the tracker setup:

1. Log in to [app.sealmetrics.com](https://app.sealmetrics.com)
2. Go to **Settings → Tags & API info**
3. Select **1st Party Tracker**

## How to Install Sealmetrics’ First-Party Tracker

Before installing Sealmetrics’ first-party tracker, complete the following steps:

1. The setup screen will display the subdomain you need to create.  
   If you plan to track multiple domains, create the same subdomain for each domain.

2. Add an **A record** in your DNS Manager with the following value: 45.148.1.221 
3. Notify us at [hello@sealmetrics.com](mailto:hello@sealmetrics.com) once you’ve completed the two tasks above.

4. When you receive the confirmation email from [hello@sealmetrics.com](mailto:hello@sealmetrics.com),  
copy and paste the provided **Tracker Code** snippet into the `<head>` section of your website.

And then — the magic starts! ✨  
Sealmetrics will begin tracking immediately.
