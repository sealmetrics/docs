# Setting Up Tracking in Sealmetrics

Sealmetrics uses a single tracking pixel to collect all data: pageviews, conversions, and microconversions.
This guide walks you through configuring your tracking from the dashboard.

---

## Step 1: Find Your Pixel Code

1. Log in to your [Sealmetrics Dashboard](https://my.sealmetrics.com).
2. Go to **Settings → Pixels** in the sidebar.
3. Select your site from the **Pixel Status** section.
4. Copy the tracking script displayed on the page.

The pixel code looks like this:

```html
<script src="https://t.sealmetrics.com/t.js?id=YOUR_SITE_ID" defer></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID (found in **Settings → Sites → [your site]**).

---

## Step 2: Install the Pixel

The **Pixels** page shows platform-specific installation guides for:

- **WordPress** — Use the Theme Editor or a plugin like "Insert Headers and Footers"
- **Shopify** — Edit `theme.liquid` and paste before `</head>`
- **Wix** — Go to Settings → Custom Code
- **Next.js** — Use the `Script` component with `strategy="afterInteractive"`
- **Google Tag Manager** — Create a Custom HTML tag with trigger "All Pages"
- **Manual HTML** — Paste the script in the `<head>` of every page

For detailed installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](/implementation/tracker/installation).

---

## Step 3: Verify Installation

The **Pixel Status** section on the Pixels page shows real-time status for each site:

- **Active** — The pixel is receiving data
- **Inactive** — No hits received recently
- **Not installed** — No hits received yet

You can also verify manually:

1. Open your website in a browser
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Console
3. Type `typeof sealmetrics` — it should return `"function"`
4. Check the Network tab for a POST to `/event` with status **204**

---

## Step 4: Track Conversions

Conversions track goal completions with monetary value (purchases, leads, signups).

Call `sealmetrics.conv()` on your confirmation or thank-you page:

```javascript
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', 99.99);
```

You can add custom properties:

```javascript
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', 149.99, {
  currency: 'EUR',
  payment_method: 'credit_card'
});
```

---

## Step 5: Track Microconversions

Microconversions track user interactions that indicate progress toward a conversion (add to cart, form starts, video plays).

```javascript
sealmetrics.micro('add_to_cart');

sealmetrics.micro('add_to_cart', {
  product_id: 'SKU-123',
  price: '89.99'
});
```

---

## Step 6: Use the Pixel Builder (Optional)

For more complex setups, use the **Pixel Builder** on the Pixels page to create reusable pixel configurations:

1. Click **Create Pixel** in the Saved Pixels section
2. Choose the pixel type: **Pageview**, **Conversion**, or **Microconversion**
3. Configure the event label, value, and custom properties
4. Select your target platform: **JavaScript**, **GTM**, or **Tealium**
5. Copy the generated code from the preview

Saved pixels can be edited or deleted at any time.

## Privacy Considerations

Sealmetrics does not use cookies or store personal data. When tracking conversions and microconversions:

- Never include personal identifiers (order IDs, user IDs, emails) in properties
- Only track event types and aggregate values
