# Tracking Methods

Advanced tracking implementations for different technologies and frameworks. This section provides specialized guides for implementing Sealmetrics in modern web applications that require custom tracking approaches.

Single-page applications, React sites, and AJAX-based interfaces need different tracking strategies than traditional multi-page websites. Learn how to capture navigation events in SPAs, track form submissions that don't reload the page, integrate with React components, and control which page views are recorded to ensure accurate analytics data.
