# Google Search Console Integration

Connect your **Google Search Console** account to the Sealmetrics AI Agent to unlock powerful SEO insights directly within your analytics workflow. Query search performance data, detect optimization opportunities, and inspect URL indexing status — all through natural language.

## Features

Once connected, you can ask the AI Agent questions like:

- *"Show me my top search queries this month"*
- *"Which pages get the most impressions but low CTR?"*
- *"Find SEO quick wins for my site"*
- *"Is my new blog post indexed by Google?"*
- *"What's my average position for branded keywords?"*

### Available Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Search Analytics** | Clicks, impressions, CTR, and position data by query, page, country, or device |
| **Quick Wins Detection** | Automatic identification of high-potential keywords in positions 4-10 |
| **URL Inspection** | Check indexing status and crawl information for any URL |
| **Sitemap Management** | View sitemap status, errors, and submit new sitemaps |

## Connecting Google Search Console

### Step 1: Access Integrations Settings

1. Log in to **[agent.sealmetrics.com](https://agent.sealmetrics.com)**
2. Click on your **profile icon** in the top-right corner
3. Select **Settings**
4. Navigate to the **Integrations** tab

### Step 2: Connect Your Google Account

1. In the Integrations panel, find **Google Search Console**
2. Click the **Connect** button
3. You'll be redirected to Google's authorization page
4. Select the Google account that has access to your Search Console properties
5. Review the permissions and click **Allow**

:::info Permissions Required
The integration requests read-only access to your Search Console data (`webmasters.readonly` scope) plus write access for sitemap management. Your data is never stored permanently — it's only accessed when you make a query.
:::

### Step 3: Select Your Property

After authorization:

1. The AI Agent will automatically detect your Search Console properties
2. You can query data for any property you have access to
3. Use the `gsc_list_sites` tool to see all available properties

## Usage Examples

### Search Performance Analysis

Query your top search queries:

> "Show me my top 20 search queries for the last 30 days"

The AI Agent will retrieve:
- Query text
- Total clicks
- Total impressions
- Average CTR (%)
- Average position

### Page Performance

Analyze which pages perform best in search:

> "What pages get the most clicks from Google?"

### Quick Wins Detection

Find SEO optimization opportunities:

> "Find SEO quick wins for my site"

This identifies keywords where you:
- Have high impressions (visibility)
- Rank in positions 4-10 (striking distance)
- Have low CTR (opportunity for improvement)

These are keywords where small optimizations can yield significant traffic gains.

### URL Indexing Status

Check if a specific page is indexed:

> "Is https://mysite.com/new-blog-post indexed by Google?"

The response includes:
- Indexing verdict (PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL)
- Coverage state
- Last crawl time
- Mobile usability status

### Filter by Device or Country

Narrow your analysis:

> "Show mobile search performance for the USA"

> "What queries bring traffic from Spain?"

### Sitemap Management

Check your sitemap status:

> "Show my sitemaps and their status"

Submit a new sitemap:

> "Submit my sitemap at https://mysite.com/sitemap.xml"

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**

## Troubleshooting

### "No Search Console properties found"

This means your Google account doesn't have access to any Search Console properties. To fix:

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add your website as a property
3. Complete the verification process
4. Reconnect in Sealmetrics

### "Access denied" errors

If you see permission errors:

1. Make sure you're using the correct Google account
2. Verify you have at least "Full User" permissions on the property
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the integration

### "Token expired"

OAuth tokens expire periodically. The system automatically refreshes them, but if you see this error:

1. Disconnect the integration
2. Reconnect with fresh authorization

### Data not showing for certain dates

Search Console data typically has a 2-3 day delay. If you're querying recent dates:

1. Try expanding your date range
2. Use dates at least 3 days in the past

## Privacy & Security

- **OAuth 2.0**: We use Google's secure OAuth flow for authentication
- **Encrypted Storage**: Access tokens are encrypted at rest using AES-256
- **No Data Storage**: We don't store your Search Console data — queries are made in real-time
- **Revocable Access**: You can disconnect at any time

## Limitations

- **API Quotas**: Google limits Search Console API requests. For heavy usage, consider spreading queries throughout the day
- **Data Delay**: Search analytics data has a 2-3 day delay
- **Row Limits**: Single queries return up to 25,000 rows
