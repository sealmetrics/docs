# Event Tracking

Send custom events and conversions to Sealmetrics via API. This section covers how to programmatically track user actions, conversions, and custom events from your backend or mobile applications.

Event tracking allows you to capture important business metrics beyond page views, including purchases, sign-ups, form submissions, and any custom user interactions. Use these endpoints to build comprehensive analytics that measure your entire customer journey, from initial visit through conversion and beyond.

## Available Documentation

- [Microconversions Endpoint](./microconversions-endpoint) - Monitor smaller engagement actions like add-to-cart, newsletter signups, and form interactions
