# Accessing Real-Time Data

Sealmetrics provides complete aggregated data up to **yesterday** by default. This ensures strong privacy alignment while giving you accurate insights without requiring additional consent.

---

## Default Data View

When you open your dashboard, you will always see:

- Full, consolidated data for all past days  
- **No data for the current day**, unless you explicitly enable real-time tracking  

This protects visitors’ privacy by avoiding real-time behavioral monitoring unless opt-in is explicitly enabled.

## Viewing Today’s Real-Time Data

To access **today’s live data**, follow these steps:

1. Open your Sealmetrics dashboard  
2. Navigate to the **calendar**  
3. Check the **Real-time Tracking** checkbox

## Privacy Regulation Compliance

Real-time data is considered behavioral monitoring, and regulators require explicit opt-in for this type of data collection.

This means:

- Real-time mode is **disabled by default**  
- Activating it means you confirm valid user consent has been obtained  
- Sealmetrics keeps you compliant with GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, and PECR  

This ensures you remain fully compliant while still having the option to analyze real-time activity when necessary.

Sealmetrics’ default of providing aggregated data up to “yesterday” ensures privacy compliance by design — while still giving you access to real-time insights when user consent allows it.
