# Data Accuracy & Reconciliation

Sealmetrics is engineered to ensure **100% hit accuracy**, even during heavy load or delayed processing.

This page explains how accuracy is maintained and how your data is reconciled.

---

## Complete Hit Capture

Sealmetrics records **every hit**, even when traffic volumes are extreme.

Our pipeline guarantees:

- No dropped clicks  
- No missing events  
- No overwritten entries  
- No sampling  
- No probabilistic modeling  

Every event is processed exactly once.

## Why Data May Appear Delayed

During high traffic periods:

- The system queues incoming hits  
- Real-time dashboards may appear temporarily lower  
- Data is processed sequentially (FIFO)  
- Everything reconciles automatically once load normalizes  

This is a standard approach used by high-volume analytics platforms.

## Reconciliation Logic

All pending hits are processed in order:

1. New hits continue being captured  
2. Queued hits are processed in bulk  
3. Dashboard metrics update continuously  
4. Once the queue reaches zero, real-time accuracy resumes  

The final dataset is always complete and reliable.

## Verification Methods

Sealmetrics performs continuous checks:

- Hit count validation  
- Event ingestion verification  
- Cross-metric reconciliation  
- System-level integrity checks  

If something looks unusual (delays, gaps, spikes), the system compensates until the dataset is fully complete.

## Summary

Sealmetrics guarantees:

- No data loss  
- Full reconciliation  
- Accurate attribution  
- Reliable event tracking  

Your data is always correct — even if processing displays a temporary delay.
