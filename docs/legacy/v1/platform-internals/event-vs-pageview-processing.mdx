# Event vs Pageview Processing

Sealmetrics processes two types of hits:

- **Pageviews**
- **Events** (conversions, micro-conversions, add-to-cart, etc.)

Both follow the same privacy-first rules, but they behave differently during processing.

---

## Pageview Processing

Pageviews represent **isolated hits** generated every time a user loads a page.

Characteristics:

- Stateless  
- Required for entrance, attribution, and behavioral metrics  
- Always aggregated  
- Never linked to unique users  

Pageviews make up most incoming traffic.

---

## Event Processing

Events represent **actions** such as:

- Conversions  
- Micro conversions  
- Add-to-cart  
- Checkout  
- Lead form submissions  

Characteristics:

- Require a triggered event pixel  
- Include optional value fields (e-commerce revenue)  
- Fully aggregated  
- Never linked to user identities  

---

## Processing Prioritization

Sealmetrics prioritizes processing based on:

1. **Events** (higher priority due to business impact)  
2. **Pageviews** (high volume, processed continuously)  

This ensures revenue and conversion metrics are always accurate.

---

## Processing Under Heavy Load

During traffic spikes:

- Pageviews continue to be captured and queued  
- Events receive prioritized processing  
- All hits remain fully processed once the queue clears  

No data is ever dropped.

## Summary

| Type | Purpose | Priority | Privacy |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Pageviews** | entrances, attribution, traffic | Medium | Fully anonymous |
| **Events** | conversions, micro-actions | High | Fully anonymous |

Sealmetrics treats both as isolated hits, ensuring compliance and accuracy without tracking users.
