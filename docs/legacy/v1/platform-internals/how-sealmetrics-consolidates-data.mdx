# How Sealmetrics Consolidates Data

Understanding how Sealmetrics processes and consolidates your analytics data helps you interpret your reports, especially during high-traffic events. This guide explains how our real-time engine works, why queues appear during traffic spikes, and why this approach ensures complete and accurate analytics.

---

## Overview

Sealmetrics is designed to capture **100% of clicks with zero data loss** — even during extreme traffic peaks.  
When traffic levels exceed real-time capacity, the system activates a **safe queue-based processing model**.  

This mechanism ensures accuracy and stability without compromising performance or privacy.

---

## 1. How Sealmetrics Processes Data

### Capturing Every Click

Sealmetrics records every hit that reaches your website:

- No sampling  
- No dropped clicks  
- No partial aggregation  

Data integrity is always the top priority.

### Normal Traffic: Real-Time Processing

Under typical conditions:

1. A click occurs  
2. Sealmetrics processes it instantly  
3. Data becomes visible in your dashboard  
4. Reports update in real time  

This is how the system behaves most of the time.

## 2. What Happens During Traffic Spikes

When your site receives unusually high volumes of traffic:

1. **The system detects the spike**  
2. A processing queue is activated  
3. All new hits are captured and stored  
4. Processing continues in **strict FIFO order**  
5. No hits are ever lost  

This is a controlled, expected behaviour — not a malfunction.

### After Traffic Normalizes

Once traffic returns to normal:

- Processing accelerates  
- The queue shrinks gradually  
- All pending hits are processed  
- The system resumes real-time mode automatically  

---

## 3. Why Queueing Is Necessary

Queueing during high traffic is industry standard. Without queues, an analytics system would:

- Drop data under pressure  
- Crash from overload  
- Misattribute events due to rushed processing  

Sealmetrics avoids all of these issues by prioritizing **accuracy over immediacy** during extreme load.

---

## 4. Understanding Processing Delays

### Delays Occur When:
- Traffic exceeds normal real-time capacity  
- Spikes occur suddenly  
- High traffic continues for long periods  

### Delays Are *Not* Caused By:
- API issues  
- Server errors  
- Downtime  
- Database problems  
- Missing hits  

The system continues capturing all hits even if reporting is delayed.

---

## 5. How Long Do Delays Last?

The duration depends on spike magnitude:

| Scenario | Typical Delay |
|---------|----------------|
| Standard campaign spike | 1–4 hours |
| Large promotional event | 4–12 hours |
| Extreme viral spike | 24–48 hours (rare) |

Once the queue clears, all data appears normally.

## 6. Best Practices for High-Traffic Periods

### Before Expected Traffic Peaks
- Inform your team about potential processing delays  
- Schedule reports after traffic stabilizes  
- Focus on trends instead of minute-by-minute data  

### During Delays
- Trust the consolidation process  
- Avoid adding duplicate tracking  
- Do not modify pixel setup  
- Allow the queue to clear before making performance decisions  

### Signs You Are in Queue Mode
- Dashboard updates slow down  
- Data appears in batches  
- Recent hours may show lower values temporarily  

---

## 7. Technical Infrastructure

### Queue Architecture
Sealmetrics uses a modern, scalable infrastructure:

- Distributed processing across multiple nodes  
- FIFO queue ordering  
- Redundant failover systems  
- Automatic scaling during spikes  
- Priority handling for critical data types  

### Continuous Optimization
We continuously improve processing capacity and performance through:

- Infrastructure scaling  
- Algorithmic enhancements  
- Live system monitoring

## Conclusion

Sealmetrics uses a real-time engine capable of capturing **every click with zero loss**, even during extreme traffic events.

When traffic spikes occur:

- All data is captured  
- Reporting may slow temporarily  
- The queue resolves automatically  
- Accuracy and completeness remain intact  

This approach ensures the highest level of data reliability while keeping the system stable and privacy-compliant.
