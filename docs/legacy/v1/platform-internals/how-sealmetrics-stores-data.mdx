# How Sealmetrics Stores Data

Sealmetrics is built with a **privacy-first architecture**.  
We store only the minimum data required to deliver accurate analytics — nothing more.

This page explains how data is collected, anonymized, stored, and retained.

---

## What Sealmetrics Stores

Sealmetrics only stores **four non-personal variables**, all required for aggregated, cookieless analytics:

- Timestamp  
- User agent (processed but *never stored*)  
- URL  
- Referral URL  

We do **not** store:

- IP addresses  
- Fingerprints  
- Cookies  
- Personal identifiers  
- Cross-session identifiers  

This ensures **full compliance** with GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, and PECR.

---

## Data Anonymization

All incoming events are anonymized at the moment of collection through:

- **Immediate user-agent sanitization**  
- **No IP storage**  
- **Stateless hit processing**  
- **Aggregation-only data architecture**  

This makes it impossible to retroactively identify any user.

---

## Data Retention

Sealmetrics retains data only as long as needed for reporting:

- Pageviews  
- Conversions  
- Events  
- Campaign attribution  

All data follows strict retention rules aligned with GDPR’s **data minimization principle**.

---

## Storage Location

All data is processed and stored exclusively in:

**Ireland (EU)**  
On secure, redundant infrastructure.

This ensures full alignment with EU data protection requirements.

---

## Security Controls

Our infrastructure uses:

- Encrypted data transport (HTTPS end-to-end)  
- Encryption at rest  
- Granular access control  
- Internal audit logs  
- Isolated processing clusters  
- Continuous monitoring

## Summary

Sealmetrics stores only what is required for analytics.  
No personal data. No cookies. No identifiers.  
A fully privacy-compliant architecture designed for the long-term future of analytics.
