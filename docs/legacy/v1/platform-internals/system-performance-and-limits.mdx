# System Performance & Limits

Sealmetrics is built to scale automatically and handle continuous traffic without data loss.

This document explains the key performance characteristics and system limits.

---

## Auto-Scaling Infrastructure

The platform uses distributed, scalable processing clusters designed to:

- Handle high traffic loads  
- Automatically allocate new processing resources  
- Maintain low latency  
- Protect against overload scenarios  

---

## Processing Capacity

Sealmetrics processes millions of hits per hour.

Key behaviors:

- Pageviews scale horizontally  
- Events receive priority allocation  
- Queueing activates only during extreme spikes  

---

## Theoretical Limits

While there is no hard cap, factors affecting performance include:

- Sudden traffic surges  
- Sustained multi-hour peak load  
- Highly event-heavy sites  
- Multiple high-traffic domains on the same account  

Even in extreme situations, all hits remain captured.

## Fault Tolerance

Sealmetrics architecture includes:

- Redundant clusters  
- Automatic failover  
- No single point of failure  
- Protected write-ahead logs  
- Distributed queuing  

This prevents:

- Data loss  
- Corruption  
- Partial ingestion failures

## Summary

Sealmetrics offers a robust, auto-scaling, fault-tolerant infrastructure designed for real-world analytics at scale.  
No data loss. No sampling. No shortcuts.
