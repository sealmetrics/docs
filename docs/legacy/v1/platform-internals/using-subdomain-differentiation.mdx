# Using Subdomain Differentiation in URL Analytics

Sealmetrics allows you to analyze performance and user behavior **across different subdomains** of the same website. This is essential for businesses using structures like:

- `www.yoursite.com` (main site)  
- `blog.yoursite.com` (blog)  
- `app.yoursite.com` (app or platform)  
- Additional country/product subdomains

## Where to Find Subdomain Analytics

2. Open the **Funnel** section  
3. Click **Top Pages**  
4. Enable the **Subdomain toggle**  

---

## Dashboard Sections

### **1. Subdomain Overview**
Shows traffic breakdown by subdomain:

- Total pageviews  
- Traffic percentage  
- Entrances  
- Transitions  

---

### **2. Cross-Subdomain Flow**
Visualizes how users move between subdomains:

- Direction of movement  
- Transition volume  
- Drop-offs  
- Bottlenecks  

---

### **3. Top URLs by Subdomain**
For each subdomain, Sealmetrics shows:

- Top entry pages  
- High-traffic pages  
- URLs sending traffic to other subdomains  
- Conversion-related pages  

---

## Common Use Cases

### **Use Case 1 — Track Conversions Across Subdomains**
For example, content lives on the main domain and purchases happen on a subdomain.

This helps identify:

- Where users drop off  
- Which subdomain drives conversions  
- Which steps create friction  

---

### **Use Case 2 — Measure Content Performance**
Track whether blog posts drive users to core product pages.

---

### **Use Case 3 — Education / Multi-Page Onboarding**
Universities or SaaS onboarding flows spread across subdomains benefit from:

- Seeing how students/prospects move between subdomains  
- Understanding which pages influence actions  

---

## Troubleshooting

### No data for a specific subdomain?
Check:

- The same Sealmetrics tracker is installed  
- No DNS settings block requests  
- No CSP policy blocks tracking  

### Inconsistent data?
Ensure:

- All subdomains use the same protocol (HTTP or HTTPS)  
- No external scripts interfere with the tracker

Subdomain differentiation gives you clear visibility into **cross-property user journeys**, helping you understand how users move across your entire digital environment.
