# Do Temporary Session Identifiers (Session IDs) Require Consent Under GDPR?

A common question around privacy-compliant analytics is whether **temporary Session IDs** fall under “tracking technologies” that require user consent.  
The short answer: **it depends on how the Session ID is implemented**.

## When Session IDs *Do* Require Consent

A temporary Session ID **requires consent** if:

- It is **stored in a cookie** or similar persistent storage  
- It can be used to **recognize a user over time**  
- It can be combined with other identifiers to **reconstruct a profile**  
- It is used for **tracking across multiple domains**  

In these cases, the Session ID becomes a **personal identifier**, making consent mandatory under:

- **GDPR**
- **ePrivacy Directive**
- Local guidelines (CNIL, AEPD, ICO…)

## When Session IDs *Do Not* Require Consent

Regulators such as **CNIL (France)** and **AEPD (Spain)** explicitly allow “cookie-less session identifiers” for **audience measurement**, *as long as* they meet **strict conditions**:

### Conditions for Consent-Free Session IDs

- **Used exclusively for audience measurement** (no marketing / profiling)  
- **No cross-site tracking**  
- **Not persistent** → disappears after the browser session ends  
- **Not stored in cookies or localStorage**  
- **Cannot be combined with other identifiers** to re-identify the user  
- **No fingerprinting techniques**  

If all these requirements are met, the Session ID is considered **non-identifying**, and consent is not required.

## How Sealmetrics Ensures Compliance

Sealmetrics provides two measurement modes to adapt to different privacy levels:

### 1. Session ID Mode  
✔ Temporary Session IDs  
✔ Fully compliant with CNIL & AEPD consent exemptions  
✔ No persistence  
✔ No personal identification  

Session IDs are used only within the active session to group hits — never to track or identify users.

### 2. Super-Privacy Mode (Isolated Hits)  
✔ **No Session IDs at all**  
✔ No cookies  
✔ No identifiers  
✔ Maximum anonymity  

This mode guarantees **absolute compliance** with GDPR, ePrivacy, and the strictest interpretations of privacy law.

## Summary

| Scenario | Requires Consent? | Why |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| Session ID stored in a cookie | **Yes** | Persistence = identification |
| Temporary ID without cookies | **No** | Cannot identify the user |
| Cross-site session tracking | **Yes** | Considered profiling |
| Isolated hits (no Session ID) | **No** | No identifiers at all |
