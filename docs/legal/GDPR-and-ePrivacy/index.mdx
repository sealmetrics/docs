# GDPR and ePrivacy

Learn about GDPR and ePrivacy compliance with Sealmetrics. This section addresses the legal framework that enables consentless analytics in the European Union.

Understanding GDPR Article 6(1)(f) legitimate interest and ePrivacy Directive exemptions is crucial for implementing privacy-compliant analytics. We explain how session-based tracking works within these legal frameworks, why session identifiers don't require consent when properly implemented, and how Sealmetrics ensures full compliance while capturing complete visitor data.
