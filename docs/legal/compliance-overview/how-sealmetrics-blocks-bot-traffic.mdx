# How Sealmetrics Blocks Bot Traffic Without Handling IPs

Sealmetrics is designed from the ground up to protect user privacy while delivering accurate analytics. A frequent question is: **How does Sealmetrics block bot traffic without using IP addresses?**  
Here’s how we do it—fully compliant, fully anonymous.

---

## Why Sealmetrics Does Not Use IP Addresses

IP addresses are legally considered **personal data** under GDPR, ePrivacy, and rulings from authorities such as:

- CNIL (France)  
- AEPD (Spain)  
- EDPS (EU)  

Even if an IP address is:

- truncated,  
- hashed,  
- used briefly for filtering,  
- or never stored,  

processing it **still counts as handling personal data**.

Because Sealmetrics is a **consentless analytics platform**, we cannot process IPs without breaking that model.

### Using IPs would require:
- A lawful basis for processing  
- Explicit user consent  
- Additional legal and security obligations  

That’s why **Sealmetrics does not process, store, or use IP addresses at all — not even for bot filtering**.

This is intentional and central to our privacy-by-design architecture.

## How Sealmetrics Filters Bot Traffic Without IPs

Instead of relying on IP filtering, we use a **privacy-safe, fully anonymous system based on User Agents**.

### What is a User Agent?
A *user agent* is a text string that browsers (and bots) send automatically, describing:

- browser type  
- device  
- OS  
- automation flags (in many cases)  

Bots typically identify themselves clearly through their user agents.

---

## Method 1 — Automatic Bot Detection via User Agent Lists

Sealmetrics maintains an updated list of known bot user agents, such as:

- search engine crawlers  
- uptime monitors  
- headless browsers  
- known automation tools  

When a hit arrives:

✔ We check the user agent  
✔ If it matches a bot signature  
→ We discard it immediately  
❌ No IP needed  
❌ No personal data processed

This keeps analytics clean without compromising compliance.

---

## Method 2 — Behavioral Bot Filtering (No IP Required)

Sealmetrics also detects suspicious automated behavior patterns, such as:

- too many hits in a short time,  
- non-human navigation patterns,  
- abnormal request timing.

This allows us to block automated traffic without relying on IP addresses.

> **All filtering occurs without identifying or tracking individuals.**

---

## Why This Approach Is Fully Privacy-Compliant

Using user agents for bot filtering is permitted because:

- User agents are **not personal data** (when not stored raw).
- Sealmetrics does **not store** user agent strings.
- No tracking identifiers are used.
- No correlation between hits is possible.
- No user or device profiling is performed.

This means we can filter bot traffic **without consent** and without violating GDPR or ePrivacy rules.

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✔ 100% GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, and PECR compliant  
No IPs → No personal data → No consent required.

### ✔ Accurate analytics  
Bot traffic is filtered out automatically while keeping user data anonymous.

### ✔ No risk of re-identification  
The system cannot reconstruct sessions, journeys, or identities.

### ✔ Privacy-by-design  
Filtering is done in a way that respects the strictest privacy standards.
