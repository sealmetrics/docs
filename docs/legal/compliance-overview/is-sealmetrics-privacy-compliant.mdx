# Is Sealmetrics GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, and PECR Compliant?

Yes — **Sealmetrics is fully compliant** with the strictest global privacy regulations, including:

- **GDPR** (European Union)  
- **ePrivacy Directive** (EU)  
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)  
- **PECR** (UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations)

Sealmetrics achieves this by operating on a **privacy-first, cookieless, consentless measurement model** based entirely on **isolated hits**.

---

## 1. European Infrastructure & Legal Alignment

Sealmetrics is a **European company**, and:

- All servers are located in **Dublin, Ireland**  
- All data is processed within the **EU**  
- No personal data is transferred outside the EU  
- Operations comply with GDPR’s strict data handling requirements  

This ensures full alignment with EU data protection laws.

## 2. Compliant by Design: No Personal Data, No Tracking

Sealmetrics does **not**:

- Track individual users  
- Correlate hits across time  
- Build user profiles  
- Use cookies, localStorage, fingerprinting, or identifiers  
- Insert any tracking code in the user’s terminal beyond the measurement script  

This architectural model ensures there is **no processing of personal data**, eliminating the need for cookie banners or consent.

## 3. Based on “Isolated Hits” — No User Tracking

Sealmetrics does not track sessions or users.  
Instead, it measures **isolated page views (hits)** that are *never linked together*.

### For each hit, Sealmetrics collects only four variables:

1. **Timestamp**  
2. **User Agent** *(captured but **not stored**)*  
3. **Current URL**  
4. **Referral URL**  

These four elements allow meaningful analytics, but **do not enable any type of identification or re-identification**, keeping the process fully anonymous and compliant.

## 4. ePrivacy Directive Interpretation

Sealmetrics follows a strict privacy interpretation:

> **Tracking individual users without consent is not permissible — even anonymously — under the ePrivacy Directive.**

Because Sealmetrics never tracks individuals and never correlates hits, measurement remains fully compliant without needing consent.

This makes Sealmetrics one of the only analytics platforms capable of providing **cookieless and consentless analytics** that still offer valuable insights.
