# Data Intermediation Services: From Mandatory to Voluntary

The EU Data Governance Act (DGA) created a framework for trusted data intermediation—platforms that facilitate data sharing between individuals, businesses, and researchers. But the mandatory registration regime proved too burdensome, with only 27 providers registering instead of the expected 100-150.

The Digital Omnibus transforms data intermediation from a mandatory compliance burden into a **voluntary trust label system**, removing barriers while maintaining quality standards. This change, combined with abolishing the separate legal entity requirement, could save €318,750 one-off and €6 million annually while encouraging market growth.

## What Are Data Intermediation Services?

### Definition

**Data intermediation service providers** act as neutral intermediaries facilitating data sharing between:

**Data holders** → **Data intermediary** → **Data users**

**Key characteristic**: Neutrality—the intermediary does not use the data for its own purposes.

### Types of Data Intermediation Services

#### 1. Data Marketplaces

**Function**: Platforms connecting data sellers and buyers

**Examples**:
- B2B data exchanges (industrial sensor data, logistics data)
- Personal data marketplaces (individuals sell their shopping/browsing data)
- Public sector data platforms

**Value**: Discovery, valuation, contracting, secure transfer

#### 2. Data Sharing Platforms

**Function**: Infrastructure enabling data sharing for specific purposes

**Examples**:
- Research data sharing (health research consortia)
- Supply chain data sharing (collaborative logistics)
- Smart city data platforms (municipal data for urban planning)

**Value**: Technical interoperability, governance, access control

#### 3. Data Cooperatives

**Function**: Member-owned organizations pooling and sharing data on behalf of members

**Examples**:
- Agricultural cooperatives (farmers share equipment/weather data)
- Consumer data cooperatives (pooled shopping data for collective benefit)
- Professional data cooperatives (freelancers share skills/availability data)

**Value**: Collective bargaining power, shared benefits, democratic governance

#### 4. Personal Data Intermediaries

**Function**: Services helping individuals exercise data portability rights

**Examples**:
- Personal data stores (individuals aggregate data from multiple sources)
- Data portability platforms (move data between services)
- Consent management platforms (centralized consent control)

**Value**: User control, simplified data management, privacy enhancement

## The Current DGA Framework (Pre-Omnibus)

### Mandatory Notification/Registration

**DGA Chapter III (Articles 9-15)** establishes:

**Notification requirement**:
- Data intermediation providers must notify competent authority
- Notification before commencing services
- Detailed information about activities, safeguards, governance

**Registration**:
- Competent authority registers compliant providers
- National registers published
- Union-level register maintained by Commission

**Compliance obligations**:
- Neutrality (cannot use data for own purposes)
- Separate legal entity requirement
- Transparency reports
- Monitoring and auditing
- Compliance with cybersecurity standards

### Why It Hasn't Worked

#### Only 27 Registered Providers

**Expected**: 100-150 providers by 2024

**Actual**: 27 providers as of late 2025

**Gap**: 73-123 fewer providers than projected

**Why the shortfall?**

#### 1. Separate Legal Entity Requirement

**DGA Article 12(1)**: Data intermediaries must be established as separate legal entities "for the sole purpose of providing data intermediation services."

**Cost**: Estimated **€318,750 one-off** to establish separate entity
- Legal incorporation
- Corporate structure
- Governance setup
- Accounting systems
- Tax registration
- Offices and personnel

**Problem**: Prohibitive for startups and existing businesses wanting to add data intermediation to service portfolio

**Example**: A cloud provider wanting to offer data marketplace functionality must create entirely separate company, cannot integrate with existing business

#### 2. Continuous Monitoring Obligations

**DGA Article 12(m)**: Implement procedures for monitoring compliance

**Cost**: Estimated **€6 million annually** across the sector
- Internal compliance officers
- External audits
- Documentation and reporting
- Technical monitoring systems
- Regular reviews and updates

**Problem**: Heavy ongoing burden relative to business size; discourages market entry

#### 3. Mandatory Notification Creates Barrier

**Psychological barrier**: Notification feels like asking permission (even though it's not authorization)

**Administrative burden**: Preparing notification, collecting required documentation, responding to competent authority queries

**Uncertainty**: Unclear whether specific business model qualifies; risk of notification rejection

**Delay**: Time from notification to registration delays market entry

#### 4. Rulebook Requirement for Data Altruism

**DGA Article 21**: Recognized data altruism organizations must have publicly available rulebook

**Content**: Purpose, data use, safeguards, governance

**Problem**: For voluntary, public-interest activity, requiring formal rulebook is disproportionate

**Impact**: Deters organizations from offering data altruism frameworks

## Changes in the Digital Omnibus

### 1. Notification Becomes Voluntary

**Key change**: Notification shifts from **mandatory** to **voluntary**

**How it works**:

**Mandatory regime (current DGA)**:
- Must notify to operate
- Cannot offer services without registration
- Enforcement for non-compliance

**Voluntary regime (Digital Omnibus)**:
- Can operate without notification
- Notification earns "trusted intermediary" label
- Market choice whether to certify

**Trust label system**:
- Providers meeting DGA standards can notify
- Receive official recognition
- Use "EU Trusted Data Intermediary" designation (or similar)
- Listed in public registers
- Marketing advantage from trust label

**Benefits**:

**For startups and small providers**:
- Can test business models without notification
- Enter market faster
- Scale up, then notify if desired
- No upfront compliance costs for experimentation

**For established providers**:
- Choice to differentiate via trust label
- Can operate without label if preferred (lower costs)
- Market decides value of certification

**For data users/holders**:
- Can choose certified intermediaries for higher trust
- Or use uncertified for lower cost/more flexibility
- Market competition on trust vs. price

### 2. Separate Legal Entity Requirement Removed

**DGA Article 12(1)** removed; replaced with **functional separation** requirement

**Functional separation means**:
- Data intermediation services must be operationally separate within organization
- Cannot use data accessed via intermediation for other business purposes
- Technical and organizational safeguards for separation
- Audit trails and access controls
- But NOT a separate legal entity

**Savings**: **€318,750 one-off** per provider avoiding separate entity setup

**Impact**:

**Cloud providers** can offer data marketplace functionality:
- Functional separation: Intermediation data isolated
- Technical measures: Access controls, encryption, logging
- Governance: Internal walls between teams
- But: Single legal entity, integrated billing, shared infrastructure

**Existing platforms** can add data sharing features:
- E-commerce platform adds supplier data sharing
- IoT platform adds sensor data marketplace
- SaaS provider adds customer data portability tools
- Without spinning off separate company

**Example**:

**Before (separate entity required)**:
- Company X operates cloud storage
- Wants to offer B2B data marketplace
- Must create Company Y (separate entity)
- Company Y operates marketplace
- Company X and Y have formal separation
- Result: €318,750 setup cost, duplicate infrastructure

**After (functional separation sufficient)**:
- Company X operates cloud storage
- Adds data marketplace service (same entity)
- Implements functional separation (access controls, governance)
- Result: No separate entity cost, integrated services, still compliant

### 3. Simplified Monitoring

**Continuous monitoring obligation reduced**

**Lighter regime**:
- Risk-based supervision instead of continuous monitoring
- Self-assessment with spot checks
- Periodic reviews instead of constant auditing
- Proportionate documentation

**Savings**: **€6 million annually** across sector

**Impact**: Lower ongoing compliance costs make market entry viable for more providers

### 4. Union-Level Registers Only

**National registers**: Eliminated (multiple Member State registers created confusion)

**Union register**: Single EU-wide register maintained by Commission

**Benefits**:
- One place to find all EU trusted intermediaries
- No need to check 27 national registers
- Clearer for cross-border services
- Less administrative burden

### 5. Data Altruism Simplifications

**Rulebook requirement**: **Deleted**

**National policy reporting**: **Deleted**

**Simplified registration**:
- Lighter application process
- Fewer ongoing obligations
- Focus on genuine public interest purposes

**Impact**: Encourages voluntary data sharing for research, statistics, public good

## Expected Impact

### Market Growth

**Projected**: Up to **36 new providers** entering market post-Omnibus

**Reasoning**:
- Voluntary regime removes entry barrier
- Functional separation cuts €318,750 cost
- Lighter monitoring reduces ongoing burden

## Practical Guidance

### For Aspiring Data Intermediaries

**Step 1: Determine if you qualify**

You're a data intermediary if you:
- Facilitate data sharing between data holders and users
- Act neutrally (don't use data for your own purposes)
- Provide technical, legal, or commercial intermediation

You're NOT a data intermediary if you:
- Process data as a controller (use for your own purposes)
- Simply provide infrastructure (cloud storage without intermediation)
- Operate outside the EU

**Step 2: Choose your path**

**Option A: Operate without notification**
- Pros: No compliance costs, faster launch, test business model
- Cons: No trust label, cannot market as "EU trusted intermediary"
- Best for: Startups, experimental models, low-trust-requirement markets

**Option B: Notify and get trust label**
- Pros: Marketing advantage, listed in EU register, customer trust
- Cons: Compliance obligations, monitoring, transparency reporting
- Best for: Established providers, high-trust markets (health, financial data)

**Step 3: Implement functional separation**

Even without notification, best practice:
- Separate intermediation data from other business data
- Access controls and encryption
- Internal policies prohibiting data use for own purposes
- Audit logging
- Staff training

**Step 4: Consider notification later**

Start without notification → Grow → Notify when business case justifies:
- Customer demand for trust label
- Competitive differentiation
- Regulatory comfort
- Market maturity

### For Organizations Using Data Intermediaries

**Evaluate trust needs**:

**High-trust scenarios** (health data, financial data, sensitive research):
- Prioritize EU trusted intermediaries (notified, in register)
- Verify compliance with DGA standards
- Check transparency reports and audits

**Lower-trust scenarios** (non-sensitive B2B data, public data):
- Consider uncertified intermediaries (lower cost)
- Assess functional separation measures
- Contractual safeguards

**Due diligence**:
- Does intermediary have conflicts of interest?
- What are their data use policies?
- What technical safeguards are in place?
- What's their incident response capability?
- Check EU register if trust label claimed

### For Data Altruism Organizations

**Simplified requirements**:
- No rulebook needed (though transparency about purposes still valuable)
- Lighter registration process
- Focus on genuine public interest

**Steps**:
1. Define public interest purpose (research, statistics, public good)
2. Establish transparent data use policies
3. Implement safeguards for donated data
4. Register with competent authority (simplified process)
5. Use European data altruism consent form
6. Report on use of data (lighter requirements)

**Examples**:
- Health data altruism for medical research
- Mobility data for traffic planning
- Energy data for sustainability research
- Educational data for pedagogy improvement

## Transition Provisions

### Existing DGA Registrations

**Automatically transferred** to Digital Omnibus regime:
- No need to re-register
- Existing registrations remain valid
- Can continue operating under same terms

**Can opt into new regime**:
- Remove separate legal entity (restructure into parent company with functional separation)
- Benefit from simplified monitoring
- Lighter ongoing obligations

### Grace Period Expected

**Likely**: 6-12 month transition after Data Act consolidation takes effect

**During transition**:
- Existing providers adapt to new requirements
- New providers can enter under new regime
- Competent authorities update processes

## Risks and Safeguards

### Risk: Loss of Trust Without Mandatory Regime

**Concern**: Voluntary notification means uncertified intermediaries operate

**Mitigation**:
- Trust label creates two-tier market (certified vs. uncertified)
- High-value/sensitive data sharing gravitates to certified intermediaries
- Market disciplines uncertified providers (reputational risk)
- Functional separation still required (baseline safeguard)

### Risk: Race to the Bottom

**Concern**: Providers avoid notification to cut costs; market fails

**Mitigation**:
- Data holders and users demand trust label for valuable data
- Regulatory enforcement on functional separation (even for uncertified)
- GDPR, NIS2, and other regulations provide baseline safeguards
- Market will support both certified and uncertified segments

### Safeguards Maintained

Even under voluntary regime:

**Neutrality requirement**: Cannot use intermediated data for own purposes (enforced via functional separation)

**Transparency**: Certified intermediaries must publish transparency reports

**Security**: Cybersecurity standards apply (NIS2, GDPR security)

**Data subject rights**: GDPR rights enforceable regardless of certification

**Competent authority oversight**: Supervision of certified intermediaries continues

## Key Takeaways

1. **Notification shifts from mandatory to voluntary** (trust label system)
2. **Separate legal entity requirement removed** (functional separation sufficient)
3. **€318,750 one-off savings** per provider from entity requirement removal
4. **€6 million annual savings** across sector from lighter monitoring
5. **Expected 36+ new providers** entering market post-Omnibus
6. **From 27 to 60-65+ providers** creates competitive market
7. **Trust label differentiates** certified intermediaries from uncertified
8. **Data altruism simplified** (no rulebook, lighter registration)
9. **Union-level register only** (national registers eliminated)
10. **Startups can test models** without notification, certify later if desired

The transformation of data intermediation from mandatory compliance to voluntary certification represents a sophisticated regulatory evolution. Instead of forcing all providers through the same heavy regime (which failed—only 27 registered), the Omnibus creates a light baseline (functional separation) with optional certification for those seeking trust differentiation. This approach should unlock the data sharing market's potential while maintaining safeguards for high-trust scenarios. The result: more providers, more innovation, more data sharing, and more economic value—exactly what the Data Governance Act aimed for, but this time with a framework that actually works.
