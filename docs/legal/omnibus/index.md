# EU Digital Omnibus Regulation

The **EU Digital Omnibus Regulation** (COM(2025) 837) represents the most significant simplification of European data law since the GDPR came into force in 2018. Published on November 19, 2025, this comprehensive reform consolidates five separate data regulations into two, eliminates cookie banners for 60% of websites, and promises to save businesses €1 billion annually.

## What is the Digital Omnibus?

The Digital Omnibus is part of the European Commission's broader simplification agenda to reduce regulatory complexity while maintaining strong protections for citizens and businesses.

**Official designation**: COM(2025) 837 final

**Published**: November 19, 2025

**Goal**: Simplify the EU data regulatory framework by:
- Reducing the number of overlapping regulations
- Eliminating contradictions and ambiguities
- Lowering compliance costs
- Maintaining high standards for data protection and privacy

## The Great Consolidation: 5 Laws → 2 Laws

### Laws Being Amended (Not Repealed)

#### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
**Status**: Amended with targeted improvements

The GDPR remains the cornerstone of EU data protection but receives important updates:
- Personal data definition clarified
- Cookie consent rules integrated (new Articles 88a, 88b)
- AI processing provisions (new Article 88c)
- Breach notification threshold raised
- Research exemptions expanded
- Information requirements simplified

See: [GDPR Amendments in Detail](./gdpr-changes.md)

#### Data Act
**Status**: Becomes consolidated framework for data sharing and access

The Data Act absorbs provisions from:
- Data Governance Act
- Open Data Directive
- Free Flow of Data Regulation (partially)

**Result**: Single comprehensive regulation for data access, sharing, and portability across sectors.

### Laws Being Repealed or Merged

#### 1. Platform-to-Business Regulation (EU 2019/1150)
**Status**: Fully repealed

**Reason**: Superseded by the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA), which provide more comprehensive and effective rules for platform governance.

**What this means**: No separate P2B compliance regime; platform obligations now governed by DSA/DMA.

#### 2. Free Flow of Data Regulation (EU 2018/1807)
**Status**: Mostly repealed; core provisions merged into Data Act

**Provisions retained:**
- Freedom of data flows within the EU
- Restrictions on data localization requirements
- Portability of non-personal data

**Why consolidate**: Avoids fragmentation between personal data (GDPR) and non-personal data (Free Flow) rules.

#### 3. Data Governance Act (EU 2022/868)
**Status**: Merged into Data Act

**Key provisions integrated:**
- Data intermediation services
- Data altruism organizations
- Public sector data re-use
- Governance structures for data sharing

**Benefit**: Single coherent framework for data governance instead of overlapping regulations.

#### 4. Open Data Directive (EU 2019/1024)
**Status**: Merged into Data Act

**What's integrated:**
- Public sector information re-use
- High-value datasets
- Transparency requirements
- Charging principles

**Result**: Public and private data sharing governed by unified rules.

### The Final Landscape

**Before Omnibus (2024):**
- GDPR
- Data Act
- Data Governance Act
- Open Data Directive
- Free Flow of Data Regulation
- P2B Regulation

**Total**: 6 major data regulations

**After Omnibus (2026+):**
- GDPR (amended)
- Data Act (consolidated)

**Total**: 2 major data regulations

**Plus**: DSA and DMA continue to govern digital platforms

## Key Changes Overview

### 1. Cookie Consent Reform

**The biggest change**: Article 5(3) ePrivacy Directive repealed for personal data; cookies brought under GDPR framework.

**New regime (Articles 88a, 88b GDPR):**
- Audience measurement for own use: **NO CONSENT NEEDED**
- Third-party tracking: **CONSENT REQUIRED**
- Single-click refuse button mandatory
- No re-asking for 6 months after refusal
- Browser signals for machine-readable consent (24-48 month timeline)

**Impact:**
- 60% of cookies no longer need consent
- 50% of private websites can eliminate banners
- 80% of public sector websites can eliminate banners
- €820M/year business savings
- €500M/year user productivity gains

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does the Omnibus repeal the GDPR?

**No.** The GDPR is **amended**, not repealed. It remains the foundational data protection regulation but receives targeted improvements.

### When will cookie banners disappear?

**Partial elimination starting mid-2027** (6 months after entry into force, estimated).

**60% of cookies** will no longer need consent (first-party, aggregated, own use).

**40% of cookies** (third-party tracking, advertising) will still require consent.

### What happens to the ePrivacy Directive?

**Article 5(3) is repealed** for personal data processing. Cookie consent moves to GDPR (Articles 88a, 88b).

**Rest of ePrivacy Directive** remains in force for:
- Non-personal data cookies
- Electronic communications confidentiality

**Long-term**: ePrivacy Regulation (currently stalled) may eventually replace the entire ePrivacy Directive.

### Do I still need a cookie banner?

**It depends on what you're doing:**

**No banner needed if:**
- ✅ First-party analytics only
- ✅ Aggregated measurement
- ✅ For your own use only
- ✅ Functional cookies for requested services

**Banner still needed if:**
- ❌ Third-party tracking
- ❌ Advertising pixels
- ❌ Cross-site profiling
- ❌ Selling or sharing data

**See**: [Cookie Consent Reform](./cookies-eprivacy.md) for detailed guidance.

### How does this affect my GDPR compliance?

**Mostly simplifies:**
- Personal data definition clearer

## Conclusion

The EU Digital Omnibus represents a pragmatic evolution of European data law. By consolidating five regulations into two, eliminating cookie banners for benign processing, and clarifying ambiguities in the GDPR, the Omnibus promises to reduce compliance costs by €1 billion annually while maintaining the EU's world-leading privacy standards.

For website operators, the message is clear: privacy-respecting, first-party analytics will become the norm, while invasive tracking faces increasing barriers. Organizations that embrace consentless analytics and first-party data strategies will gain competitive advantages in compliance simplicity, data quality, and user experience.

The transition period (2026-2030) provides ample time to adapt. Those who prepare early will reap the greatest benefits.
