# Best Practices for LENS AI

Get more accurate, actionable insights by following these best practices when asking questions.

## Writing Better Questions

### Be Specific About Time

❌ **Vague:** *"How is traffic?"*

✅ **Better:** *"How did traffic change last week compared to the week before?"*

✅ **Best:** *"Compare daily traffic for Jan 8-14 vs Jan 1-7, broken down by source"*

### Include Context

❌ **Missing context:** *"Why did conversions drop?"*

✅ **With context:** *"Why did conversions drop on January 10th? We launched a new landing page that day."*

### Specify Metrics

❌ **Ambiguous:** *"How are we performing?"*

✅ **Clear:** *"What's our conversion rate, average order value, and total revenue for this month?"*

### Name Your Segments

❌ **Unclear:** *"How's mobile doing?"*

✅ **Precise:** *"What's the conversion rate for mobile users from paid search in the US?"*

## Question Templates

### Traffic Analysis

```
"Show me [metric] for [time period], broken down by [dimension]"

Examples:
• "Show me sessions for last 30 days, broken down by source"
• "Show me pageviews for this week, broken down by device"
• "Show me unique users for January, broken down by country"
```

### Conversion Analysis

```
"What's the [conversion type] rate for [segment] over [time period]?"

Examples:
• "What's the purchase rate for mobile users over the last 7 days?"
• "What's the signup rate for UK visitors over this quarter?"
• "What's the add-to-cart rate for organic traffic over Black Friday week?"
```

### Comparison Questions

```
"Compare [metric] for [segment A] vs [segment B] during [time period]"

Examples:
• "Compare conversion rate for new vs returning visitors during January"
• "Compare revenue from Google vs Facebook campaigns last month"
• "Compare mobile vs desktop bounce rate this week"
```

### Trend Analysis

```
"How has [metric] trended over [time period]? Highlight any [anomalies/changes]"

Examples:
• "How has conversion rate trended over the last 90 days? Highlight any drops"
• "How has traffic from Google trended this year? Note any significant changes"
• "How has average order value trended since we launched the new pricing?"
```

### Investigation Questions

```
"Why did [metric] [increase/decrease] on [date/period]? Check [potential factors]"

Examples:
• "Why did traffic spike on March 15? Check for referral sources"
• "Why did conversion rate drop last Tuesday? Check by device and source"
• "Why did revenue increase 40% yesterday? Break down by product category"
```

## Conversation Techniques

### Build on Previous Answers

LENS remembers context. Use it:

```
You: What was our conversion rate last week?
LENS: 2.3%, down from 2.8% the week before...

You: Break that down by traffic source
LENS: [Uses same time period automatically]
      Google Ads: 2.8%
      Organic: 1.9%
      ...

You: Why is organic lower?
LENS: [Investigates organic specifically]
      Organic conversion rate is lower because...
```

### Ask for Recommendations

```
You: Which campaigns should I scale based on last month's performance?

LENS: Based on ROAS and volume, I recommend:

1. Scale: "Winter Sale - Retargeting" (ROAS 4.2, €12k spend)
2. Scale: "Brand Search" (ROAS 6.8, €5k spend)
3. Test increase: "Lookalike Audiences" (ROAS 2.8, €3k spend)

Campaigns to reduce:
• "Cold Audiences - Interest" (ROAS 0.8)
```

### Request Specific Formats

```
You: Give me a table comparing all traffic sources for last month,
     sorted by conversion rate, including sessions, conversions,
     and revenue columns

LENS:
| Source      | Sessions | Conversions | CR    | Revenue  |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Email       | 12,450   | 498         | 4.0%  | €24,900  |
| Google Ads  | 45,230   | 1,130       | 2.5%  | €45,200  |
| Organic     | 34,120   | 682         | 2.0%  | €27,280  |
...
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Ask Multiple Unrelated Questions

❌ *"What's our traffic? Also, what's the best performing campaign? And can you show me revenue by country?"*

✅ Ask one topic at a time, then follow up.

### Don't Assume LENS Knows Your Goals

❌ *"Is this good?"*

✅ *"Is a 2.3% conversion rate good compared to our historical average?"*

✅ *"How does our 2.3% conversion rate compare to last year?"*

### Don't Forget Time Zones

If your data spans multiple time zones:

✅ *"What was traffic on January 10th PST?"*

✅ *"Show me hourly traffic in UTC"*

### Don't Overlook Segments

Generic questions get generic answers:

❌ *"Why is bounce rate high?"*

✅ *"Why is bounce rate high for mobile users from Facebook ads landing on the homepage?"*

## Getting Help with LENS

### When LENS Isn't Sure

LENS will tell you when confidence is low:

```
LENS: I found a correlation between the traffic drop and your
      Google Ads pause, but I'm only 60% confident this is the
      main cause. Other factors might include:
      • Server response time increased 200ms that day
      • It was a holiday in Germany (your second-largest market)

      Want me to investigate any of these further?
```

### When Data Is Insufficient

```
LENS: I don't have enough data to answer this reliably.

      You asked about conversion rate by city, but:
      • 73% of sessions have no city data
      • Only 12 cities have >100 sessions

      Would you like me to analyze by country instead?
```
