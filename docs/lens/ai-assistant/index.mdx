# AI Chat Assistant

The LENS AI Chat Assistant lets you ask questions about your analytics data in natural language. Get instant answers, comparisons, and insights without building custom reports.

## How to access

The AI Chat Assistant is available in your dashboard sidebar. Click the LENS icon to open the chat panel.

## What you can ask

The assistant can answer questions about your analytics data, including:

- **Traffic summaries**: "Give me a weekly summary" or "What were my top 5 traffic sources?"
- **Comparisons**: "Compare this month with last month"
- **Trend analysis**: "Why did my ROAS drop?" or "What's causing the traffic increase?"
- **Source analysis**: "Which campaigns are performing best?"
- **Conversion insights**: "What are my top converting landing pages?"

The assistant supports both English and Spanish.

## Response types

The assistant doesn't just return text. Responses can include:

- **Charts**: Visual bar charts and trend lines embedded in the conversation
- **Tables**: Structured data tables with your metrics
- **Insights**: AI-generated analysis and recommendations

## Sessions

- Conversations are organized into sessions
- Sessions expire after 4 hours of inactivity
- You can browse previous conversations in the sidebar
- Start a new session anytime by clicking "New conversation"

## Usage limits

Each plan includes a monthly quota of AI questions. Your remaining questions are shown in the chat interface. The counter resets at the beginning of each billing period.
