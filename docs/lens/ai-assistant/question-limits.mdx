# Question Limits

Each Sealmetrics plan includes a monthly allocation of LENS AI questions. This page explains how limits work and your options when you need more.

## Limits by Plan

| Plan | Questions/Month |
|------|-----------------|
| **Starter** | 500 |
| **Growth** | 1,000 |
| **Scale** | 2,000 |
| **Pro** | 5,000 |
| **Enterprise** | Custom |

Questions reset on the first day of each billing cycle.

## What Counts as a Question

### Counts as 1 question:
- Asking a new question
- Requesting a follow-up analysis
- Asking for more detail on a response

### Does NOT count:
- Viewing previous conversations
- Clicking suggested follow-up questions (first click free)
- Viewing anomaly explanations
- Automated report generation

## Checking Your Usage

### In the Dashboard

1. Go to **LENS > Chat**
2. View the usage indicator in the top right:

```
Questions used: 127 / 500
```

### Via Account Settings

1. Go to **Settings > Billing**
2. View **Lens AI Questions** in the Usage card

## Usage Alerts

You'll receive notifications at:

| Threshold | Notification |
|-----------|--------------|
| 80% used | Email alert |
| 100% used | In-app notification |

## When You Reach Your Limit

When you use all included questions:

### Option 1: Purchase Question Pack

Add questions immediately with a one-time purchase:

| Pack | Questions | Price |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Standard | 500 | €99 |

Question packs never expire and carry over month-to-month. You can purchase multiple packs at once.

### Option 2: Upgrade Your Plan

If you consistently need more questions, consider upgrading to a plan with a higher monthly allocation.

### Option 3: Wait for Reset

Questions reset on billing cycle date. Check **Settings > Billing** for your reset date.

## Optimizing Question Usage

### Ask Specific Questions

More specific questions = better answers with fewer follow-ups.

**Vague:** *"How's my site doing?"*

**Specific:** *"Compare conversion rate for paid vs organic traffic this month"*

### Use Follow-up Suggestions

Clicking suggested follow-ups is more efficient:
- First suggested follow-up is free
- More precise than typing new questions

### Combine Related Questions

Instead of multiple questions:

*"What was traffic last week?"*
*"What were conversions last week?"*
*"What was revenue last week?"*

Try: *"Give me a summary of traffic, conversions, and revenue for last week"*

### Use Reports for Recurring Questions

If you ask the same questions regularly:
1. Ask LENS once
2. Create a scheduled report with that data
3. Receive updates automatically (doesn't use questions)

## Team Usage

For accounts with multiple users:

- Questions are shared across all team members
- Each user can see team usage in their dashboard

## Billing Details

### Viewing LENS Charges

1. Go to **Settings > Billing > Invoices**
2. Click on an invoice
3. View itemized LENS charges if you purchased question packs

## FAQ

### Do automated reports use questions?

No. Scheduled LENS reports don't count against your question limit.

### Can I get a refund for unused questions?

Unused included questions don't roll over and aren't refundable. Question packs never expire.

### What happens if I downgrade my plan?

You keep access to purchased question packs. Included questions change to the new plan's allocation.

### Are there API limits separate from chat?

Yes. API calls to LENS endpoints have separate rate limits. See [API documentation](/api/rate-limits).
