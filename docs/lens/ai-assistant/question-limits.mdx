# Question Limits

Each Sealmetrics plan includes a monthly allocation of LENS AI questions. This page explains how limits work and your options when you need more.

## Limits by Plan

| Plan | Questions/Month | Overage Rate |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Research** | 50 | €0.50/question |
| **Guard** | 200 | €0.40/question |
| **Growth** | 500 | €0.30/question |

Questions reset on the first day of each billing cycle.

## What Counts as a Question

### Counts as 1 question:
- Asking a new question
- Requesting a follow-up analysis
- Asking for more detail on a response

### Does NOT count:
- Viewing previous conversations
- Clicking suggested follow-up questions (first click free)
- Viewing anomaly explanations
- Automated report generation

## Checking Your Usage

### In the Dashboard

1. Go to **LENS → Chat**
2. View the usage indicator in the top right:

```
Questions used: 127 / 200
├────────────────────░░░░░░░░│
                    63%
```

### Via Account Settings

1. Go to **Settings → Usage**
2. View **LENS Questions** section:

```

Remaining:       73
Overage:         0

Daily average:   6.3 questions
Projected:       195 (within limit)
```

## Usage Alerts

You'll receive notifications at:

| Threshold | Notification |

| 100% used | In-app notification |
| Overage | Email with usage details |

Configure alerts in **Settings → Notifications → Usage Alerts**.

## When You Reach Your Limit

When you use all included questions:

### Option 1: Continue with Overage

- Questions continue to work
- Each additional question is billed at overage rate
- Charges appear on next invoice

```
⚠️ You've used all 200 included questions.

Additional questions will be billed at €0.40 each.

[Continue] [Wait for Reset]
```

### Option 2: Purchase Question Pack

Add questions immediately:

| Pack | Questions | Price | Per Question |
|------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Small | 100 | €39 | €0.39 |
| Medium | 250 | €89 | €0.36 |
| Large | 500 | €159 | €0.32 |

Packs never expire and roll over month-to-month.

### Option 3: Upgrade Your Plan

If you consistently need more questions:

| Current → Upgrade | Additional Questions | Price Difference |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Research → Guard | +150/month | +€200/month |
| Guard → Growth | +300/month | +€200/month |

### Option 4: Wait for Reset

Questions reset on billing cycle date. Check **Settings → Billing** for your reset date.

## Optimizing Question Usage

### Ask Specific Questions

More specific questions = better answers with fewer follow-ups.

❌ **Vague:** *"How's my site doing?"*

✅ **Specific:** *"Compare conversion rate for paid vs organic traffic this month"*

### Use Follow-up Suggestions

Clicking suggested follow-ups is more efficient:
- First suggested follow-up is free
- More precise than typing new questions

### Combine Related Questions

Instead of multiple questions:

❌ *"What was traffic last week?"*
❌ *"What were conversions last week?"*
❌ *"What was revenue last week?"*

✅ *"Give me a summary of traffic, conversions, and revenue for last week"*

### Use Reports for Recurring Questions

If you ask the same questions regularly:
1. Ask LENS once
2. Create a scheduled report with that data
3. Receive updates automatically (doesn't use questions)

## Question Rollover Policy

| Plan | Unused Questions |
|------|------------------|
| Research | Do not roll over |
| Guard | Do not roll over |
| Growth | Roll over up to 250 |
| Question Packs | Roll over indefinitely |

## Team Usage

For accounts with multiple users:

- Questions are shared across all team members
- Each user can see team usage in their dashboard
- Admins can set per-user limits (Growth plan only)

### Setting Per-User Limits (Growth)

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Click on a user
3. Set **Monthly LENS Limit**

```
User: sarah@company.com
Role: Analyst
LENS Limit: 100 questions/month

[Save]

## FAQ

### Do automated reports use questions?

No. Scheduled LENS reports don't count against your question limit.

### Can I get a refund for unused questions?

Unused included questions don't roll over and aren't refundable. Question packs never expire.

### What happens if I downgrade my plan?

You keep access to purchased question packs. Included questions change to the new plan's allocation.

### Are there API limits separate from chat?

Yes. API calls to LENS endpoints have separate rate limits. See [API documentation](/api/rate-limits).
