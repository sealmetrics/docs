# Getting Started with LENS

Get LENS configured and receiving insights in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A Sealmetrics account with an active plan
- At least 7 days of tracking data (for meaningful anomaly detection)
- Email notifications enabled in your account settings

## Step 1: Access LENS

1. Log in to your Sealmetrics dashboard
2. Click **LENS** in the main navigation
3. You'll see the LENS overview with any detected anomalies

## Step 2: Configure Alert Preferences

Set up how and when you want to receive notifications:

1. Go to **LENS → Settings**
2. Configure your preferences:

| Setting | Options | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Alert frequency | Real-time, Hourly, Daily | Real-time for critical metrics |
| Alert channels | Email, Slack, Webhook | Enable at least email |
| Sensitivity | Low, Medium, High | Start with Medium |
| Quiet hours | Time range | Set business hours only |

3. Click **Save Preferences**

## Step 3: Review Active Rules

LENS comes with pre-configured rules based on your plan:

1. Go to **LENS → Rules**
2. Review the active rules
3. Toggle off any rules that aren't relevant to your business

### Recommended Starting Rules

For e-commerce:
- ✅ `conversion_rate_drop` - Alert when CR drops >20%
- ✅ `revenue_anomaly` - Alert on unusual revenue changes
- ✅ `traffic_drop_significant` - Alert when traffic drops >30%
- ✅ `source_performance_change` - Alert on traffic source changes

For lead generation:
- ✅ `form_submission_drop` - Alert when form fills decrease
- ✅ `traffic_quality_change` - Alert on bounce rate spikes
- ✅ `campaign_ctr_anomaly` - Alert on CTR changes

## Step 4: Ask Your First Question

Try the AI assistant:

1. Go to **LENS → Chat**
2. Type a question like:
   - *"What were my top traffic sources last week?"*
   - *"How is my conversion rate trending?"*
   - *"Are there any issues I should know about?"*
3. LENS will analyze your data and respond

### Tips for Better Answers

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific about time periods | Ask vague questions |
| Mention specific metrics | Assume LENS knows context |
| Ask follow-up questions | Ask multiple questions at once |

**Good:** *"Why did organic traffic from Google drop last Tuesday?"*

**Less helpful:** *"Why is traffic down?"*

## Step 5: Schedule Your First Report

Set up automated reporting:

1. Go to **LENS → Reports**
2. Click **Create Report**
3. Choose a template:
   - **Executive Summary** - High-level KPIs and trends
   - **Traffic Analysis** - Detailed traffic breakdown
   - **Conversion Report** - Conversion funnel analysis
4. Set the schedule (daily, weekly, monthly)
5. Add recipients
6. Click **Activate**

## Troubleshooting

### "No anomalies detected"

This is normal if:
- Your account is new (less than 7 days of data)
- Your traffic patterns are stable
- Detection sensitivity is set too low

Try adjusting sensitivity in **LENS → Settings**.

### "Question limit reached"

You've used all AI questions for the month. Options:
- Wait for the monthly reset
- Upgrade your plan for more questions
- Purchase a question pack add-on

### Alerts not arriving

Check:
1. Email notifications are enabled in account settings
2. Alerts aren't going to spam
3. Quiet hours aren't blocking notifications
4. At least one alert channel is configured
