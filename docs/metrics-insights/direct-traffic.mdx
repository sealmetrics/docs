# Understanding Direct Traffic in Sealmetrics

Direct vs Referrer traffic in Sealmetrics follows one simple rule:

- **If a referrer exists → Referrer Traffic**
- **If the referrer is empty → Direct Traffic**

This binary model ensures clear and privacy-compliant traffic source attribution.

---

## What Is Direct Traffic?

Direct traffic occurs when the **referrer field is empty**.

This means Sealmetrics received no information about the previous page the user came from.

**Key rule:**  
> **Direct traffic = referrer is empty**

---

## How Referrer Information Works

When a user clicks a link from one website to another, the browser normally sends an HTTP `referrer` header.

This header contains the URL of the previous page and helps website owners understand **where traffic comes from**.

Example referrer header:
````
Referrer: https://google.com/search?q=analytics
````
Sealmetrics reads this header (without storing personal information) to classify traffic sources.

## How Sealmetrics Classifies Referrers

If a referrer exists, Sealmetrics analyzes the domain and performs **category-based enrichment**:

### ✔ Domain recognition  
Certain domains are automatically recognized and reclassified:

- **google.com** → SEO  
- **bing.com** → SEO  
- **facebook.com** → Social  
- **instagram.com** → Social  

### ✔ Why this reclassification matters  
It provides more meaningful insight into *which channels* bring traffic to your site, instead of treating everything as a generic “referrer”.

## Why This System Matters

Sealmetrics’ referrer classification allows you to:

- Identify top-performing traffic sources  
- Understand whether traffic comes from search, social, media, or partners  
- Improve marketing strategy based on accurate channel attribution  
- Maintain full privacy compliance without tracking users individually

## Summary

- **Direct Traffic** occurs when the referrer is empty  
- **Referrer Traffic** is enriched when Sealmetrics recognizes known platforms  
- This classification provides clearer attribution while staying fully privacy-first  

Sealmetrics gives you a transparent, simple, and accurate way to understand how users arrive at your website — without cookies, without IDs, and without compromising user privacy.
