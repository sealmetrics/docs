# What Is a TERM in Sealmetrics?

In Sealmetrics, **TERM** is the smallest and most granular unit used to describe the origin of a website hit.  
It allows the platform to classify and attribute traffic accurately—while remaining fully privacy compliant.

Understanding TERM helps you better analyze user intent, keyword performance, and the exact source of each visit.

## TERM by Traffic Source

### 🔍 **1. SEO Traffic**
**TERM = Landing Page URL**

Because Sealmetrics does not track individual search queries, SEO traffic is categorized based on the **landing page** the user arrives on.

This allows you to understand:

- Which pages attract organic traffic  
- How SEO entry points evolve over time  

---

### 🌐 **2. Referrer Traffic**
**TERM = Referrer URL**

For any external website linking to you, the TERM reflects the **exact URL** that sent the visitor.

This helps you identify:

- High-value partner websites  
- Articles, directories, or media links driving traffic  
- Referral patterns across the web  

---

### 🔎 **3. Google Ads Traffic**
**TERM = Keyword that triggered the ad**

Sealmetrics reads the keyword or targeting parameter used by Google Ads (via UTMs or value-track parameters).

This gives insight into:

- Which keywords generate traffic  
- Performance of search terms  
- ROI of keyword-level bidding  

---

### 🏷️ **4. UTM Term Traffic**
**TERM = Value of the `utm_term` parameter**

If your URLs include `utm_term`, Sealmetrics uses it directly as the TERM.

Examples:

- Audience segment  
- Paid keyword  
- Creative identifier  
- Product category

## Why TERM Matters

Using TERM provides granular, privacy-friendly insights:

- Identify the *true origin* of traffic  
- Improve SEO and SEM targeting  
- Optimize marketing campaigns  
- Understand user intent without personal tracking  

TERM is a powerful element of Sealmetrics’ consentless analytics model—precise, privacy-first, and transparent.
