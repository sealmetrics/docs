# How to Find Your Site ID

Your **Site ID** is a unique identifier assigned to each site in Sealmetrics. You need it to install the tracking pixel, configure API access, and set up integrations.

The Site ID is set when the site is created and **cannot be changed** afterwards.

## Steps to Find Your Site ID

### 1. Go to **Settings**

Click the **Settings** icon (gear) in the sidebar.

### 2. Open **Sites**

In the Settings menu, click on **Sites** to see your list of sites.

### 3. Select your site

Click on the site whose ID you want to find.

### 4. Copy the Site ID

The **Site ID** is displayed in the **General** tab, right below the site name. Use the **copy button** next to it to copy it to your clipboard.

You can also find the Site ID referenced when managing [API Keys](/platform/settings/api-keys), where it appears as part of the site restrictions configuration.
