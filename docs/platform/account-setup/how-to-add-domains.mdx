# How to Add Domains to Your Site

Domains define which websites are authorized to send tracking data to your Sealmetrics site. You need at least one domain configured for tracking to work.

Sealmetrics counts a new **entrance** when the referrer is empty or comes from a different domain than your own (e.g., facebook.com → yoursite.com).

## Add a Domain During Site Creation

When you create a new site, you can add one or more domains in the creation form:

1. Go to **Settings → Sites** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New Site**.
3. Enter the site name and add your domain(s) in the **Domains** field.
4. Type a domain (e.g., `example.com`) and press **Enter** or click **+** to add it.
5. Set timezone and currency, then click **Create Site**.

## Add a Domain to an Existing Site

1. Go to **Settings → Sites** in the sidebar.
2. Click on the site you want to configure.
3. Click the **Domains** tab.
4. Type the domain (e.g., `example.com` or `sub.example.com`) in the input field.
5. Press **Enter** or click **Add**.

The domain will appear in the list and tracking will be authorized immediately.

## Remove a Domain

1. In the **Domains** tab, click the **trash icon** next to the domain you want to remove.
2. Confirm the removal in the dialog.

## Important Notes

- Domains must be in a valid format (e.g., `example.com`, `shop.example.com`).
- Subdomains are supported.
- Only one domain or its subdomains can be tracked per site (no cross-site tracking).
- If no domains are configured, you'll see a message: "No domains configured. Add your first domain to start tracking."
