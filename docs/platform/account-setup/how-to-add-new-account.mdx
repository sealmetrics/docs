# How to Add a New Site

Each site represents a website you want to track with Sealmetrics. Sites belong to an organization.

## Steps

1. Go to **Sites** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Site**
3. Enter the site name (e.g., "My Blog" or "company.com")
4. Set the site's **timezone** — this determines how dates are calculated in your reports
5. Set the **currency** for conversion tracking (default: EUR)
6. Click **Create**

Your new site will appear in the Sites list with a unique **Site ID**.

## Next steps

- **Install the tracker** on your website using the Site ID. See [Installation Guide](/implementation/tracker/installation).
- **Configure your domain** in Settings to ensure proper attribution.
- **Set up conversions** to track goals and e-commerce transactions.
