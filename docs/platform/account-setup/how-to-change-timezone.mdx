# How to Change Your Time Zone

The timezone determines how dates and times are calculated in your reports.

## Steps

1. Go to **Settings → Sites** in the sidebar.
2. Click on the site you want to configure.
3. In the **General** tab, find the **Timezone** field.
4. Select your timezone from the dropdown (you can search by name).
5. Click **Save** to apply the change.

By default, new sites use **Europe/Madrid**. The timezone list is grouped by region (America, Europe, Asia, etc.) for easier navigation.
