# Organizations

An **Organization** is the top-level entity in Sealmetrics. It groups together your websites (called **Sites**) and your team members. Everything in Sealmetrics -- billing, analytics, team access -- is managed within the context of an organization.

---

## How It Works

```
Organization
  |
  |-- Sites (your websites)
  |     |-- example.com
  |     |-- store.example.com
  |     |-- blog.example.com
  |
  |-- Members (your team)
        |-- You (Owner)
        |-- teammate@company.com (Admin)
        |-- analyst@agency.com (Member)
```

- Each **Site** represents a website you want to track with Sealmetrics.
- Each **Member** is a person on your team who can access your analytics data.
- **Sites** always belong to exactly one organization.
- **Members** can belong to multiple organizations (for example, an agency working with several clients).

---

## Creating Your Organization

After you register and verify your email, Sealmetrics will ask you to create your first organization.

1. Choose a name for your organization (typically your company name)
2. Click **Create Organization**

You are automatically assigned the **Owner** role, which gives you full access to everything.

---

## Adding Sites

Once your organization is set up, you can add the websites you want to track.

1. Go to **Sites** in the main navigation
2. Click **Add Site**
3. Enter your website's name and domain
4. Follow the setup instructions to install the tracking code

Each site gets a unique **Site ID** that is used in the tracking code. You can add as many sites as your plan allows.

---

## Inviting Team Members

Share access with your team by inviting members to your organization.

1. Go to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter their email address and choose a role:
   - **Owner** -- full access to everything, including billing
   - **Admin** -- manage members and all sites, no billing access
   - **Member** -- access only to specific sites you assign
4. For Members, select which sites they can see
5. Send the invitation

The invited person will receive an email with a link to join. If they do not have a Sealmetrics account yet, they can create one as part of the invitation process.

For more details on managing your team, see [Users & Teams](./settings/account/users).

## Roles Overview

Sealmetrics uses a two-tier role system:

**Organization roles** determine what a person can do across the organization:

| Role | Sites Access | Manage Members | Billing |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **Owner** | All sites | Yes | Yes |
| **Admin** | All sites | Yes (except owners) | No |
| **Member** | Assigned sites only | No | No |

**Site-level roles** determine what a person can do within a specific site:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Editor** | Can view data and modify site configuration |
| **Viewer** | Can view data only (read-only) |

For the full permissions breakdown, see [Roles & Permissions](./user-management/roles-management).

## Multiple Organizations

Some users may need access to more than one organization -- for example, agency staff managing multiple clients. When a user belongs to multiple organizations, they will be asked to select which organization to work in after logging in.

---

## Deleting an Organization

Only the Owner can delete an organization. Deleting an organization removes access for all members. This action requires confirming the organization name and cannot be undone.
