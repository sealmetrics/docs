# Users & Teams

Manage who has access to your Sealmetrics organization and control what they can see and do.

---

## Viewing Members

To see all members in your organization:

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in the navigation)
2. Navigate to **Organization** and select your organization
3. Open the **Members** tab

You will see a list of all current members, their email, organization role, and status.

## Inviting Members

Owners and Admins can invite new members to the organization.

### How to send an invitation

1. Open the **Members** page for your organization
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter the person's email address
4. Choose their organization role:
   - **Owner** -- full access to everything including billing
   - **Admin** -- manage members and all sites, no billing
   - **Member** -- access only to assigned sites
5. If you selected **Member**, choose which sites they should have access to
6. Click **Send Invitation**

The invited person will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation. If they do not already have a Sealmetrics account, they will be asked to create one.

### Pending invitations

Invitations expire after 7 days. You can view pending invitations on the Members page and:

- **Resend** an invitation to extend the expiration
- **Cancel** an invitation if it is no longer needed

## Assigning Sites to Members

Members can only see the sites you explicitly assign to them. Owners and Admins see all sites automatically.

### To assign sites to a member

1. Go to the **Members** page
2. Find the member in the list
3. Click on their name or the manage option
4. Select the sites they should have access to
5. Save changes

You can add or remove site access at any time without affecting the member's organization role.

## Changing a Member's Role

Owners and Admins can change organization roles for other members.

1. Go to the **Members** page
2. Find the member
3. Change their role using the role dropdown
4. Confirm the change

Role changes take effect immediately.

**Restrictions:**
- Admins cannot change the role of an Owner
- Only Owners can promote someone to Owner or demote an Owner

---

## Removing a Member

1. Go to the **Members** page
2. Find the member you want to remove
3. Click the remove option
4. Confirm the removal

The member will immediately lose access to all sites and data in the organization.

---

## User Limits

All Sealmetrics plans include **unlimited users**. There is no limit on the number of team members you can invite to your organization.

---

## Understanding Roles

Sealmetrics uses a two-tier role system:

- **Organization roles** (Owner, Admin, Member) control access at the organization level
- **Site-level roles** (Editor, Viewer) control what a user can do within a specific site

For a full breakdown of permissions, see [Roles & Permissions](../../user-management/roles-management).
