## Security Best Practices

### Regular Review

Set a schedule to review the audit log:

- **Daily:** Check for failed logins, unusual activity
- **Weekly:** Review user management actions
- **Monthly:** Full audit review for compliance

### Alert on Suspicious Activity

Configure alerts for specific events:

```
Audit Alerts
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

☑ Multiple failed logins (>5 in 10 minutes)
☑ Login from new country
☑ Admin role granted
☑ API key with full access created
☐ Any settings change
☐ Any data export

Alert to: [security@company.com         ]
```

### Investigating Incidents

When investigating a security incident:

1. **Identify timeframe** - When did the issue occur?
2. **Filter by time** - Review all activity in that window
3. **Identify actors** - Who was active during that time?
4. **Trace actions** - Follow the sequence of events
5. **Check IPs** - Look for unusual IP addresses
6. **Export evidence** - Download CSV for records

## Compliance Use Cases

### GDPR Data Access Requests

Track who accessed what data:

1. Filter by "Data Actions"
2. Search for specific user or data type
3. Export for documentation

### SOC 2 Audit Evidence

Demonstrate access controls:

1. Export authentication logs
2. Show user management history
3. Document settings changes

### Internal Security Audit

Review account security posture:

1. Check for shared credentials (multiple IPs for same user)
2. Review inactive users
3. Audit API key usage
4. Verify 2FA adoption

## Log Retention

| Plan | Retention Period |
|------|------------------|
| Research | 30 days |
| Guard | 90 days |
| Growth | 1 year |

Logs are automatically deleted after the retention period. Export regularly if you need longer retention.
