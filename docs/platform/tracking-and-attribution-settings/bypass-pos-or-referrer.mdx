# Bypass POS or Referrer

When a user completes a purchase through a **POS (Point of Sale)** or external payment page (Stripe, PayPal, Redsys…), they temporarily leave your site.  
When they return to your **thank-you page**, Sealmetrics may detect this as a new session and attribute the referrer incorrectly.

This causes conversions to appear as coming from:
❌ *payment* instead of  
✔️ the original source (Google Ads, Facebook, Email, etc.)

## How Bypass POS / Referrer Works

You can configure Sealmetrics to **ignore specific referrers**, ensuring that once users return from a payment domain, the system keeps the original traffic source instead of overwriting it.

---

## How to Set It Up

1. Go to **Accounts**
2. Click **Edit**
3. Scroll to **Referral Exclusion List**
4. Add domains you want to exclude (e.g. payment providers)
5. Click **Update**

## Why This Matters

This avoids:
- Incorrect attribution to *payment*
- Lost ROAS visibility  
- Broken marketing funnels  

You keep the **real traffic source** intact.
