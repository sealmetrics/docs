# Understanding the Difference Between Global Tracker and SuperPrivacy Tracker

At Sealmetrics, we provide two tracking options designed to prioritize user privacy while delivering actionable insights: **GlobalTracker** and **SuperPrivacyTracker**.

Both solutions serve different levels of privacy and analytical depth, depending on your compliance needs and tracking goals.

## SuperPrivacy Tracker: Maximum Anonymity, Unmatched Speed

SuperPrivacy Tracker is ideal for organizations that require **the highest level of privacy**.

This tracker measures user interactions in a **session-isolated, disconnected “hits” mode**.  
If the same user visits 6, 7, or 20 pages, the system records each hit independently — **no link is created between pages**.

### What this means:
- No user paths  
- No session reconstruction  
- No behavioral stitching  
- Maximum processing speed  
- Zero identifiable profiling  

This prevents the formation of customer journeys or behavioral patterns and ensures full compliance with strict privacy environments.

## Global Tracker: Individualized Tracking with Privacy in Mind

GlobalTracker provides a more personalized tracking approach while still respecting strict privacy standards.

Using minimal data, GlobalTracker enables:
- Session-level understanding  
- Basic behavior patterns  
- Deterministic funnels  
- Individualized metrics **without** storing personal data  

Although Global Tracker does not identify users as individuals, it allows:
- Understanding a sequence of pages viewed  
- Recognizing when multiple hits belong to the same session  
- Building privacy-safe funnels and journeys  

This makes it ideal for most websites (≈98%).
