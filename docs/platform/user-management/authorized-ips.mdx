# Access Restricted to Authorized IPs

Sealmetrics allows you to restrict platform access by IP address for maximum account security.

This feature is ideal for organizations requiring strict access control.

---

## How It Works

An Admin can define **authorized IP addresses**. Only devices connecting from those IPs can log into the platform.

Benefits:

- **Full access control**: Only trusted networks can access the platform.
- **Protection from unauthorized access**.
- **Extra security layer** on top of username + password.

---

## Who Can Use This Feature?

This feature is available for **GROWTH** plans and above.

---

## How to Set It Up

Admins can add or remove authorized IPs directly from the Settings section.
