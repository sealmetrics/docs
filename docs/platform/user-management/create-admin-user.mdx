# How to Add an Organization Admin

If you need another person to help manage your organization's members and sites, you can invite them as an **Admin**.

An Admin can:

- Access all sites in the organization
- Add, remove, and manage members
- Assign sites to Members
- View organization settings

Admins **cannot** manage billing or delete the organization -- only the Owner can do that.

## Steps

1. Go to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter the person's email address
4. Set the role to **Admin**
5. Click **Send Invitation**

The person will receive an email invitation. Once they accept, they will have Admin access to your organization immediately.
