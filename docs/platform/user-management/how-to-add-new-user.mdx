# How to Invite a Team Member

Owners and Admins can invite new members to the organization at any time.

## Steps

1. Go to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter the person's email address
4. Choose their organization role:
   - **Owner** -- full access including billing
   - **Admin** -- manage members and all sites, no billing
   - **Member** -- access only to assigned sites
5. If you selected **Member**, choose which sites they should have access to
6. Click **Send Invitation**

The person will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation. If they do not have a Sealmetrics account yet, they will be asked to create one.
