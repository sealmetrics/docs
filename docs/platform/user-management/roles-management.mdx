# Roles & Permissions

Sealmetrics uses a two-tier role system to give you fine-grained control over who can access what:

1. **Organization roles** control what a user can do across the organization (manage members, billing, settings).
2. **Site-level roles** control what a user can do within a specific site (edit configuration or view only).

These two layers are independent and combine together to determine a user's full set of permissions.

## Organization Roles

Every member of an organization has exactly one organization role: **Owner**, **Admin**, or **Member**.

| Permission | Owner | Admin | Member |
|------------|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|
| View analytics for all org sites | Yes | Yes | -- |
| View analytics for assigned sites only | -- | -- | Yes |
| Add and remove members | Yes | Yes | -- |
| Change member roles | Yes | Yes (cannot change owners) | -- |
| Invite new members | Yes | Yes | -- |
| Assign sites to members | Yes | Yes | -- |
| Access billing and subscription | Yes | -- | -- |
| Rename or delete the organization | Yes | -- | -- |
| View organization settings | Yes | Yes | -- |

### Owner

The organization creator is automatically the Owner. Owners have unrestricted access to everything in the organization, including billing, member management, and all sites.

### Admin

Admins can manage the day-to-day operations of the organization. They can add and remove members, assign sites, and access all sites. However, they cannot manage billing or modify Owner-level settings.

### Member

Members have restricted access. They can only see the specific sites that an Owner or Admin has assigned to them. They cannot manage other members or access billing.

## Site-Level Roles

Within each site, a user can have one of two roles: **Editor** or **Viewer**.

| Permission | Editor | Viewer |
|------------|:------:|:------:|
| View reports and analytics | Yes | Yes |
| Use LENS AI | Yes | Yes |
| Export data | Yes | Yes |
| Edit site configuration (tracking, integrations, etc.) | Yes | -- |
| Manage conversion goals | Yes | -- |
| Configure content grouping | Yes | -- |
| Manage BigQuery integration | Yes | -- |

### Editor

Editors can view all data and modify the site's configuration, including tracking settings, integrations, and conversion goals.

### Viewer

Viewers have read-only access to all reports and analytics data. They cannot change any site settings.

## How Roles Combine

A user's effective permissions are determined by the combination of their organization role and their site-level role. Here are some common examples:

| Org Role | Site Role | What They Can Do |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Owner** | (all sites) | Full access to everything -- all sites, billing, members, settings |
| **Admin** | (all sites) | All sites, member management, no billing |
| **Member** | **Editor** | Only assigned sites, can modify site config on those sites |
| **Member** | **Viewer** | Only assigned sites, read-only access |

:::tip
Owners and Admins automatically have access to all sites in the organization -- you do not need to assign sites to them individually. Site assignment only applies to Members.

## Choosing the Right Roles

| Scenario | Recommended Org Role | Recommended Site Role |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Business owner or account manager | Owner | -- (has all access) |
| Team lead managing the analytics setup | Admin | -- (has all access) |
| Marketing analyst on your team | Member | Editor (if they configure goals) or Viewer |
| External client reviewing reports | Member | Viewer |
| Agency partner managing tracking | Member | Editor |

:::info Best Practice
Keep the number of Owners to a minimum. Most team members work well as Admins or Members with appropriate site access.
