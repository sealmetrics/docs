# Roles Management

Sealmetrics includes two main user roles:

- **Admin**
- **User**

## Key Differences Between Roles

Admins have extended permissions that standard users do not. Specifically, an **Admin can**:

1. Add new Accounts.
2. Add new Users.
3. Grant each user access to some or all accounts.
4. Add Costs in the Cost Calculator.
5. Bypass Referrals.
6. Grant access to specific corporate IPs.

Below is an example of the user and permissions interface:

## When to Use Each Role

| Role | Best For | Permissions |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Owners, Managers, Agencies | Full platform control |
| **User** | Analysts, marketers | Limited access to assigned accounts |

Admins should be assigned sparingly to maintain operational control and security across all accounts.
