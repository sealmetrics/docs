## When to Use Each Role

| Role | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Admin** | Business owners, account managers |
| **Manager** | Team leads, agency managers |
| **Analyst** | Marketing analysts, data teams |
| **Viewer** | Clients, stakeholders (read-only access) |

:::tip Best Practice
Assign Admin role sparingly to maintain security. Most team members only need Manager or Analyst access.
