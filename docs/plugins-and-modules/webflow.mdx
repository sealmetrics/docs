**Requirements:** Webflow paid plan (Custom Code access required)
:::

## Installation

1. Log in to your **Webflow Designer**
2. Open your project
3. Click on **Project Settings** (gear icon in the left sidebar)
4. Navigate to the **Custom Code** tab
5. Scroll to the **Head Code** section
6. Paste the SealMetrics tracking code
7. Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` with your SealMetrics Account ID
8. Click **Save Changes**
9. **Publish** your site for changes to take effect

## Events Tracked

### Pageview

Automatically tracked on every page load across your site.

**Data collected:**
- Session tracking enabled

### Lead Conversion

Fired when a visitor successfully submits a Webflow form.

**Event type:** Conversion

**Data collected:**
- Form name (from `data-name` attribute)
- Page path (URL pathname)
- Page title (document title)

## Information Stored

The Webflow module collects and sends the following information to SealMetrics:

### Form Information
- **Form Name**: The name assigned to the form in Webflow (from `data-name` attribute)
- **Page Path**: Current URL pathname where the form was submitted (optional)
- **Page Title**: Document title of the page (optional)

### Privacy & Compliance

The module does **NOT** collect or store:
- Form field values
- User input or responses
- Email addresses or names
- Phone numbers
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

Only the form name and page context are tracked. All form data remains private and is handled by Webflow.

## Technical Features

### Multiple Detection Methods

The module uses three layers of detection for maximum reliability:

1. **MutationObserver**: Monitors DOM changes to detect when `.w-form-done` success message becomes visible
2. **Submit Event Listener**: Fallback for non-AJAX form submissions
3. **Fetch Interception**: Monitors AJAX requests to Webflow's form endpoints

### Form Support
- Native Webflow forms
- Both AJAX and standard form submissions
- Multi-step forms
- Custom-styled forms

### Exclusions
- Commerce checkout forms (automatically excluded)
- Forms with `data-sealmetrics-exclude` attribute

### Customization
Configure the conversion label and tracking behavior:
- Default conversion label: "lead"
- Optional page path tracking
- Optional page title tracking
- Custom form selectors support

## Configuration Options

The tracking script can be customized by editing the configuration object:

```javascript
var CONFIG = {
    accountId: 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID',
    conversionLabel: 'lead',      // Customize the conversion label
    trackPagePath: true,           // Include page URL path
    trackPageTitle: true           // Include page title
};
```

## Use Cases

### Lead Generation
Track form submissions on landing pages to measure campaign effectiveness:
- Contact forms
- Request a quote forms
- Newsletter signups
- Free trial registrations

### Multi-Page Funnels
Track conversions across different pages:
- Landing page → Contact form
- Product page → Demo request
- Pricing page → Sign up form

### Campaign Tracking
Measure the success of marketing campaigns:
- PPC landing pages
- Email campaign landing pages
- Social media campaign forms

## Troubleshooting

### Forms not tracking

1. Check that the script is in the **Head Code** section (not Footer)
2. Verify your Account ID is correctly entered
3. Ensure the site is **published** after adding the code
4. Open browser console (F12) and submit a test form
5. Look for SealMetrics event messages

### Some forms tracking, others not

1. Check if the non-tracking form has `data-sealmetrics-exclude` attribute
2. Verify the form has a `data-name` attribute in Webflow
3. Check for JavaScript errors in console
4. Ensure the form shows the success message (`.w-form-done`)

### Duplicate conversions

1. Check that tracking code is only added once (in Head Code, not in page-specific embeds)
2. Verify no other SealMetrics scripts are present
3. Test in incognito mode to rule out caching issues

### Commerce forms triggering conversions

By default, commerce checkout forms are excluded. If they're still tracking:
1. Add `data-sealmetrics-exclude` to the form element
2. Or customize the exclusion rules in the configuration

## Manual Tracking

You can manually trigger lead tracking from your custom JavaScript:

```javascript
// Track a lead conversion manually
window.sealmetricsTrackLead('Custom Form Name');
```

This is useful for:
- Custom form implementations
- Third-party form widgets
- Multi-step form completions
- AJAX-based interactions

## Best Practices

### Form Naming
Give your forms descriptive names in Webflow:
- "Contact Form - Homepage"
- "Demo Request - Pricing Page"
- "Newsletter Signup - Footer"

This makes it easier to identify which forms are converting in your SealMetrics dashboard.

### Testing
Before launching:
1. Submit test forms on your published site
2. Check that conversions appear in SealMetrics dashboard
3. Test on multiple browsers and devices
4. Verify mobile forms work correctly

### Performance
The tracking script is:
- Asynchronous and non-blocking
- Minified for production use
- Lightweight with no dependencies

## Compatibility

- All Webflow plans (Basic, CMS, Business, Enterprise)
- All Webflow templates and themes
- Webflow forms (not compatible with third-party form services)
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
