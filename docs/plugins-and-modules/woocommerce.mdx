## Troubleshooting

### Events not appearing in dashboard

1. Verify plugin is activated in **Plugins** page
2. Check that Account ID is saved in **Settings** > **SealMetrics**
3. Clear WordPress cache (if using caching plugin)
4. Enable Debug Mode and check browser console for errors
5. Test with default WooCommerce theme (Storefront) to rule out theme conflicts

### Add-to-cart not tracking

1. Check if theme overrides WooCommerce templates
2. Test AJAX vs non-AJAX add-to-cart separately
3. Look for JavaScript errors in browser console
4. Verify WooCommerce hooks are firing (use Query Monitor plugin)

### Variable product attributes not captured

1. Ensure product variations are properly configured
2. Check that attributes are set as "Visible on the product page"
3. Verify variation has a SKU assigned
4. Test with a simple product first to isolate the issue

### Checkout steps missing

1. Verify checkout page is using standard WooCommerce checkout
2. Check if theme or plugin customizes checkout process
3. Test with default WooCommerce checkout flow
4. Look for JavaScript errors during checkout

### Duplicate purchases

The plugin prevents duplicates using order meta data. If you see duplicates:
1. Clear browser cache and test in incognito mode
2. Verify the plugin is only installed once
3. Check that no other SealMetrics scripts are present
4. Look for order meta `_sealmetrics_tracked` in order details

### HPOS Compatibility

If using WooCommerce's High-Performance Order Storage:
1. The plugin is fully compatible with HPOS
2. No special configuration needed
3. Order meta is properly stored in HPOS tables

## Best Practices

### Testing
1. Enable Debug Mode during initial setup
2. Test each event type (product view, add-to-cart, checkout, purchase)
3. Test with both simple and variable products
4. Verify events appear in SealMetrics dashboard
5. Disable Debug Mode for production

### Performance
The plugin is optimized for performance:
- Lightweight code with minimal overhead
- Asynchronous script loading
- No impact on page load times
- Efficient database queries

### Variable Products
For best results with variable products:
- Always assign SKUs to variations
- Use consistent attribute naming
- Keep attribute names simple (colour, size, etc.)
