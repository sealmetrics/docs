## Technical Features

### Automatic Form Detection

The plugin uses multiple detection methods:
1. **JavaScript Event Listeners**: Hooks into form plugin success events
2. **Server-Side Backup**: Tracks AJAX form submissions as fallback
3. **HTML Form Detection**: Automatically identifies native HTML forms

### Tracking Methods

#### AJAX Forms
Most modern form plugins use AJAX:
- Contact Form 7: `wpcf7mailsent` event
- WPForms: `wpformsAjaxSubmitSuccess` event
- Gravity Forms: `gform_confirmation_loaded` event
- Ninja Forms: `nfFormSubmitResponse` event
- Formidable Forms: `frmFormComplete` event
- Elementor Forms: Success class detection

#### Non-AJAX Forms
Traditional form submissions are also tracked:
- Server-side detection using WordPress hooks
- Action parameter detection
- Success redirect tracking

### Compatibility
- WordPress 5.0+
- All major form plugins (see list above)
- Compatible with page builders (Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, etc.)
- Works with caching plugins
- Multisite compatible

## Use Cases

- Contact forms
- Request a quote forms
- Newsletter signups
- Demo requests
- Free trial registrations

- Landing pages
- Service pages

### Multi-Step Forms

## Troubleshooting

### Forms not tracking

1. Check that the plugin is activated
2. Verify Account ID is saved in settings
3. Check the Settings page to see which form plugins are detected
4. Open browser console (F12) and submit a test form
5. Look for SealMetrics event messages
6. Clear cache if using a caching plugin

### Specific form plugin not working

1. Verify the form plugin is active and updated
2. Check if form plugin appears in **Settings** > **SealMetrics** detected plugins list
3. Test with a simple form first
4. Look for JavaScript errors in console
5. Try disabling other plugins to identify conflicts

### Page context not capturing

1. Enable page tracking options in **Settings** > **SealMetrics**
2. Verify page has proper WordPress post type
3. Check that permalink structure is set (not default `?p=123`)
4. Test with a standard post or page first

### Duplicate conversions

The plugin includes JavaScript-side deduplication. If you see duplicates:
1. Clear browser cache and test in incognito mode
2. Verify the plugin is only installed once
3. Check that no other SealMetrics scripts are present on the site
4. Disable any form submission tracking in theme or other plugins

### Multi-Step Forms

For multi-step forms:
1. The plugin tracks final submission only (not intermediate steps)
2. Ensure form plugin fires success event on completion
3. Some multi-step forms may need custom tracking implementation

### AJAX vs Non-AJAX Submissions

If forms use both AJAX and traditional submissions:
1. The plugin handles both methods automatically
2. Check which method your form uses in form plugin settings
3. Test both submission methods if available

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Conversion Labels

Use different conversion labels for different purposes:
- `lead` - General lead forms
- `contact` - Contact forms
- `quote` - Quote request forms
- `demo` - Demo request forms
- `newsletter` - Newsletter signups

Change this in **Settings** > **SealMetrics** > **Conversion Label**

### Page Type Customization

Control which page types to track:
1. Enable "Track page type" in settings
2. Use WordPress conditional tags
3. Forms on any page type will be tracked with appropriate context

### Multiple Forms Per Page

If you have multiple forms on one page:
- Each form is tracked separately
- Form IDs differentiate between forms
- All forms on the page will be tracked

## Best Practices

### Form Naming
Give your forms descriptive names in the form builder:
- "Contact Form - Homepage"
- "Quote Request - Services Page"
- "Newsletter Signup - Footer"

This makes identification easier in your SealMetrics dashboard.

### Testing
Before going live:
1. Submit test forms on different pages
2. Check that conversions appear in SealMetrics dashboard
3. Test each form plugin separately
4. Verify mobile forms work correctly
5. Test with caching enabled

### Performance
The tracking script is optimized:
- Asynchronous loading
- No impact on form submission
- Lightweight code
- No external dependencies

## Compatibility with Other Plugins

### Caching Plugins
Compatible with:
- WP Super Cache
- W3 Total Cache
- WP Rocket
- LiteSpeed Cache

The JavaScript tracking works even with page caching enabled.

### Page Builders
Works seamlessly with:
