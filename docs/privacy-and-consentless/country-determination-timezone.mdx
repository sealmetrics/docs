# Country Determination Without Using IP Addresses

## Timezone-Based Geo Estimation

Sealmetrics determines the country of origin for each event ("hit") using the **timezone configured in the user's browser**. This method provides an approximate geographic estimation without processing IP addresses or collecting personal identifiers.

### 1. Retrieving the Timezone

The browser exposes the timezone value through standard APIs such as:

``` js
Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone
```

Examples of possible values include:\
- `Europe/Madrid`\
- `America/Santiago`\
- `Asia/Tokyo`

This information is provided directly by the user's device and **does not contain identifiable data**, nor does it allow individual tracking.

### 2. Mapping Timezone to Country

Each timezone is matched against an internal table connecting **IANA
timezones** to the countries that use them.

-   For unique timezones (e.g., `Asia/Tokyo`), the country is determined
    with high confidence.\
-   For shared timezones (e.g., `Europe/Paris`), the system selects the
    most likely country based on majority usage or internal statistical
    criteria.

The resulting estimation is accurate enough for aggregated analytics and
attribution metrics, although it cannot guarantee absolute precision in
every case.

### 3. Privacy & Compliance

This approach fully adheres to privacy and data-minimization principles:

-   No IP addresses are processed at any point.\
-   No unique device identifiers are stored.\
-   Timezone information does not identify the user.\
-   Country calculation relies solely on non-personal technical data
    provided by the browser.

Thanks to this method, Sealmetrics can offer meaningful geographic
insights while preserving user privacy and operating without requiring
consent for tracking.
