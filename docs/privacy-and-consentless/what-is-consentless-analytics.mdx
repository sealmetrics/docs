# What is Consentless Analytics?

**Consentless Analytics** is a privacy-first approach that allows businesses to analyze user behavior without requiring explicit visitor consent — while maintaining full compliance with GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, CCPA, and PECR.

## How Consentless Analytics Works

Traditional tools like Google Analytics depend on cookies and consent. When users reject consent, businesses lose up to **85% of traffic data**. Consentless Analytics eliminates this issue through Sealmetrics’ **Dual Tracking System**:

### Session-ID Based Tracking
- Assigns a unique temporary ID per session  
- Enables detailed session analysis  
- Provides full behavioral accuracy without user identification  

### Isolated Hits Based Tracking
- Records each interaction separately  
- Captures complete behavioral data  
- Prevents linking events across sessions

Sealmetrics ensures analytics that are both powerful and ethically responsible.
