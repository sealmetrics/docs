## Tracking Conversions

### JavaScript API

Track conversions using the tracker:

```javascript
// Basic conversion
sealmetrics.conv('purchase');

// Conversion with revenue
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', 99.99);

// Conversion with properties
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', 149.99, {
  product_id: 'SKU-123',
  category: 'Electronics'
});
```

### Microconversions

Track engagement events:

```javascript
// Basic microconversion
sealmetrics.micro('add_to_cart');

// Microconversion with properties
sealmetrics.micro('video_play', {
  video_id: 'intro-video',
  duration: 120
});
```

See [Tracker Documentation](/tracker/conversions) for complete implementation guide.

## Attribution

### Last-Touch Attribution

Sealmetrics uses last-touch attribution by default:

- Conversion attributed to the session where it occurred
- Source/medium of that session gets credit
- Simple and transparent model

### Multi-Session Users

For users who convert after multiple sessions:

- Each session tracked independently
- Conversion credited to the converting session
- Use Unique Users to understand user-level conversion

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use consistent, descriptive conversion type names:

| Good | Avoid |
|------|-------|
| purchase | conv1 |
| newsletter_signup | signup |
| request_demo | form |
| add_to_cart | cart |

### Revenue Values

- Always pass numeric values (not strings)
- Use consistent currency
- Include only the transaction amount
- Don't include tax/shipping unless relevant

### Testing Conversions

Before going live:

1. Test each conversion type
2. Verify revenue values are correct
3. Check properties are captured
4. Confirm data appears in report
