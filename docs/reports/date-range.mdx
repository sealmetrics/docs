| **Custom** | Manually selected comparison range | Any dates you choose |

### Comparison Display

When comparison is enabled:

#### Stat Cards

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Current value | Main number |
| Delta percentage | Change from comparison period |
| Delta color | Green (improvement), Red (decline), Gray (no change) |

Example:
```
Entrances
12,450
↑ +15.2%
```

#### Charts

- Primary line/area: Current period
- Secondary line (dashed): Comparison period
- Hover tooltip shows both values

#### Tables

Some tables show comparison columns when enabled.

### Reading Delta Values

| Delta | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| +25% (green) | 25% increase vs comparison |
| -10% (red) | 10% decrease vs comparison |
| 0% (gray) | No change |
| N/A | No comparison data available |

### Metric Interpretation

For some metrics, "improvement" means decrease:

| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Entrances | Increase (green) |
| Conversions | Increase (green) |
| Revenue | Increase (green) |
| Bounce Rate | Decrease (green) |

Sealmetrics colors deltas appropriately based on metric type.
