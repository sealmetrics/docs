## Traffic Metrics

### Entrances

**Definition:** The number of sessions (visits) that started during the selected period.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Counting | Each new session counts as 1 entrance |
| Session start | First pageview after 30 minutes of inactivity |
| Use case | Measure traffic volume |

**Example:** A user visits your site at 9:00 AM, leaves, and returns at 3:00 PM. This counts as 2 entrances.

### Pageviews

**Definition:** The total number of pages viewed during the selected period.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Counting | Each page load counts as 1 pageview |
| Reloads | Page refresh counts as new pageview |
| Use case | Measure content consumption |

**Example:** A user visits 5 pages in one session. This counts as 5 pageviews and 1 entrance.

### Unique Visitors

**Definition:** The number of distinct users who visited during the selected period.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Identification | Cookieless (no cookies required) |
| Cross-device | Same user on different devices counts as different visitors |
| Use case | Measure audience size |

**Example:** One user visits 3 times in a day. This counts as 1 unique visitor, 3 entrances.

### Bounce Rate

**Definition:** The percentage of sessions where the user viewed only one page and then left.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Formula | (Single-page sessions / Total sessions) × 100 |
| Range | 0% to 100% |
| Lower is better | Generally indicates better engagement |

**Interpretation:**

| Bounce Rate | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| < 40% | Excellent engagement |
| 40-55% | Good |
| 55-70% | Average |
| > 70% | May need improvement |

**Exceptions:** Some pages naturally have high bounce rates (contact pages, single-purpose landing pages).

### Engaged Entrances

**Definition:** The number of sessions where the visitor viewed more than one page.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Counting | Session with 2+ pageviews counts as 1 engaged entrance |
| Threshold | Minimum 2 pageviews required |
| Use case | Measure quality of traffic |

**Example:** A user visits your homepage and then navigates to a product page. This counts as 1 engaged entrance. If they only view the homepage and leave, it does not count as engaged.

**Relationship to Bounce Rate:**
- Engaged Entrances = Entrances - Bounces
- A session is either engaged OR a bounce, never both

### Engagement Rate

**Definition:** The percentage of sessions where visitors viewed more than one page.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Formula | (Engaged Entrances / Total Entrances) × 100 |
| Range | 0% to 100% |
| Higher is better | Indicates quality traffic and relevant content |

**Interpretation:**

| Engagement Rate | Interpretation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| > 60% | Excellent - visitors find content relevant |
| 40-60% | Good |
| 20-40% | Average |
| < 20% | May indicate traffic quality issues |

**Note:** Engagement Rate + Bounce Rate = 100%. They are inverse metrics.

### Pages per Session

**Definition:** The average number of pages viewed per session.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Formula | Total Pageviews / Total Entrances |
| Minimum | 1.0 (every session has at least one pageview) |
| Use case | Measure content engagement depth |

**Interpretation:**

| Pages/Session | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| > 4 | Excellent engagement |
| 2-4 | Good |
| 1-2 | Low engagement |
| ~1 | Most sessions are bounces |

**Example:** 10,000 pageviews from 4,000 entrances = 2.5 pages per session.

## Conversion Metrics

### Conversions

**Definition:** The total number of completed conversion events during the selected period.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Counting | Each `sealmetrics.conv()` call counts as 1 |

| Use case | Measure goal completions |

**Example:** A user makes 2 purchases in one session. This counts as 2 conversions.

### Conversion Rate

**Definition:** The percentage of sessions that resulted in at least one conversion.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Formula | (Sessions with conversions / Total sessions) × 100 |
| Range | 0% to 100% |

| Aggregation | Sum of all conversion amounts |

**Example:**
```javascript
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', 99.99);  // Adds 99.99 to revenue
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', 149.50); // Adds 149.50 to revenue
// Total revenue: 249.49
```

### Delta Colors

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green | Improvement |

| Gray | No change or N/A |

**Note:** For Bounce Rate, a decrease (negative delta) is shown in green because lower bounce rate is better.
