| **Bounce Rate** | Single-page session percentage |
| **Events** | Microconversions |
| **Conversions** | Completed conversions (with progress bar) |
| **Conv. Rate** | Conversion rate |
| **Revenue** | Total revenue |

#### Charts

- **Pie Chart**: Distribution of traffic by device type
- **Bar Chart**: Conversion rate comparison across devices

Same metrics as Browsers tab, with OS name instead of browser.

## Charts

Each tab includes visual representations:

### Device Types Pie Chart

- Shows percentage distribution
- Desktop vs Mobile vs Tablet
- Quick visual of audience composition

### Conversion Rate Bar Chart

- Horizontal bars per device/browser/OS
- Compare conversion performance
- Identify underperforming segments

## Filtering

### Table Filter Builder

Each tab has its own filter builder:

**Available fields:**
- Device/Browser/OS (name)
- Entrances
- Pageviews
- Bounce Rate
- Conversions
- Revenue

**Example filters:**

| Goal | Filter |
|------|--------|
| High-traffic browsers | Entrances greater than 500 |
| Converting devices | Conversions greater than 0 |
| Problem areas | Bounce Rate greater than 60 |
| Revenue-generating | Revenue greater than 100 |

### Global Device Filters

Use global filters to focus analysis:

1. Click **Add Filter** in the global filter bar
2. Select **Device Type**, **Browser**, or **Operating System**
3. Choose specific values
4. All reports filter to selected devices

## Device Performance Analysis

### Mobile vs Desktop

| Metric | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| Mobile bounce rate higher | Check mobile UX, page speed |
| Mobile conversion lower | Review mobile checkout flow |
| Mobile traffic growing | Prioritize mobile optimization |
| Desktop revenue higher | Consider device-specific offers |

### Browser Compatibility

Issues to investigate when a browser shows poor metrics:

| Symptom | Possible Cause |
|---------|----------------|
| High bounce rate | CSS/JS compatibility issues |
| Zero conversions | Checkout not working |
| Low pageviews | Navigation problems |
| Missing data | Tracking blocked |

### OS-Specific Patterns

| Pattern | Action |
|---------|--------|
| iOS lower conversion | Check Apple Pay, Safari issues |
| Android high bounce | Test on popular Android devices |
| Windows 11 issues | Check new browser features |

## Use Cases

### Identifying Mobile Issues

1. Go to **Device Types** tab
2. Compare Mobile vs Desktop:
   - Bounce Rate difference
   - Conv. Rate difference
   - Revenue per session
3. If Mobile underperforms significantly:
   - Audit mobile experience
   - Check Core Web Vitals for mobile
   - Review mobile checkout flow

### Browser Compatibility Testing

1. Go to **Browsers** tab
2. Sort by **Bounce Rate** (descending)
3. Filter: Entrances > 100 (significant sample)
4. High bounce on specific browser indicates:
   - JavaScript errors
   - CSS rendering issues
   - Feature incompatibility

### OS Market Share Tracking

1. Go to **Operating Systems** tab
2. Note distribution percentages
3. Compare with development testing:
   - Are you testing on top 3 OS?
   - Any untested OS with significant traffic?

### Revenue by Device

1. Go to **Device Types** tab
2. Sort by **Revenue** (descending)
3. Calculate revenue per entrance for each
4. Prioritize optimization for highest-value devices

### Safari/iOS Tracking Verification

Due to ITP (Intelligent Tracking Prevention):

1. Go to **Browsers** tab
2. Compare Safari metrics with Chrome
3. If Safari shows unusual patterns:
   - Very low conversion rate
   - Shorter sessions
   - Consider Safari-specific analysis

## Technical Considerations

### User Agent Detection

Device, browser, and OS are detected from the User-Agent header. Consider:

- User-Agent can be spoofed
- Some privacy tools mask User-Agent
- New browsers may be miscategorized temporarily

### Browser Privacy Features

Modern browsers increasingly block tracking:

| Browser | Privacy Feature |
|---------|-----------------|
| Safari | Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) |
| Firefox | Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) |
| Brave | Aggressive tracker blocking |
| Chrome | Privacy Sandbox (upcoming) |

Sealmetrics is designed to work with these features, but some metrics may be affected.

### Mobile App Traffic

If you have a mobile app:
- App traffic may appear as specific browser/OS
- Consider filtering or segmenting app vs web
- WebView traffic categorized by underlying browser
