# Evolution

The Evolution report shows how your metrics change over time, with flexible grouping and UTM filtering.

## Accessing the Report

1. Select a site from the site selector
2. Click **Evolution** in the sidebar

**URL pattern:** `/sites/{site_id}/evolution`

## Time Grouping

Control how data is aggregated using the grouping selector:

| Grouping | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **Day** | Short periods (7-30 days), daily patterns |
| **Week** | Medium periods (1-3 months), weekly trends |
| **Month** | Long periods (6+ months), seasonal analysis |

## UTM Filters

Filter data by specific traffic sources:

### Available Filters

| Filter | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **UTM Source** | Traffic source | google, facebook, newsletter |
| **UTM Medium** | Traffic medium | cpc, organic, email |
| **UTM Campaign** | Campaign name | black-friday-2025, brand-awareness |

### Applying UTM Filters

1. Click the dropdown for the desired filter (Source, Medium, or Campaign)
2. Select one or more values
3. Data updates to show only matching traffic
4. Active filters appear as removable chips below the dropdowns

### Combining Filters

Filters combine with AND logic:
- Source = "google" AND Medium = "cpc" shows only Google Ads traffic
- Add Campaign = "brand-2025" to narrow further
