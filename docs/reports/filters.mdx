|----------|----------|--------|
| Country = Spain | Device = Mobile | Spanish mobile visitors |
| Medium = cpc | Source = google | Google Ads traffic |
| Browser = Safari | Country = USA | US Safari users |

Each table in reports has its own filter builder for granular filtering within that specific table.

- Consistent analysis across reports

### Use Local Filters For

- Finding specific items in tables

- Then refine with specific filters
- Save common combinations as segments
