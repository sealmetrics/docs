# Funnel

The Funnel report visualizes user progression through defined conversion steps, showing drop-off rates and bottlenecks.

## Accessing the Report

1. Select a site from the site selector
2. Click **Funnel** in the sidebar

**URL pattern:** `/sites/{site_id}/funnel`

## Funnel Selector

Choose which funnel to analyze from the dropdown at the top of the report.

### Available Funnels

Funnels are configured in Settings. Common examples:

| Funnel | Typical Steps |
|--------|---------------|
| E-commerce Checkout | View Product → Add to Cart → Checkout → Purchase |
| Lead Generation | Landing Page → Form View → Form Submit → Thank You |
| SaaS Signup | Homepage → Pricing → Sign Up → Verify Email |
| Content Engagement | Article View → Scroll 50% → Scroll 100% → Share |

## Funnel Visualization

### Bar Chart

Vertical bar chart showing progression through steps.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Bars** | Height represents users at each step |
| **Labels** | Step name and user count |
| **Drop-off arrows** | Show percentage leaving between steps |
| **Colors** | Gradient from first to last step |

### Reading the Funnel

From left to right:
1. First bar = users who entered the funnel
2. Each subsequent bar = users who completed that step
3. Arrows between bars = users who dropped off
4. Last bar = users who completed the entire funnel

## Metrics Table

Detailed breakdown below the visualization.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Step** | Step name/number |
| **Users** | Users who reached this step |
| **Entry Rate** | Percentage of funnel entrants who reached this step |
| **Completion Rate** | Percentage of previous step who completed this step |
| **Drop-off** | Users who left at this step |
| **Drop-off Rate** | Percentage who left at this step |

### Example Metrics

| Step | Users | Entry Rate | Completion | Drop-off |
|------|-------|------------|------------|----------|
| View Product | 10,000 | 100% | - | 3,000 |
| Add to Cart | 7,000 | 70% | 70% | 4,000 |
| Checkout | 3,000 | 30% | 43% | 1,500 |
| Purchase | 1,500 | 15% | 50% | - |

## Funnel Steps

### Step Types

Steps can be defined as:

| Type | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Pageview** | User visits specific URL | /checkout |
| **Event** | Microconversion fires | add_to_cart |
| **Conversion** | Conversion fires | purchase |

### Step Configuration

Configure funnels in Settings → Funnels:

1. Click **Create Funnel**
2. Name the funnel
3. Add steps in order
4. For each step, define:
   - Step name
   - Step type (pageview/event/conversion)
   - Matching criteria (URL pattern or event type)
5. Save the funnel

### URL Matching

For pageview steps, URL patterns support:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| /checkout | Exact match |
| /products/* | Any product page |
| /blog/** | Blog and all subpaths |

## Funnel Analysis

### Key Metrics to Watch

| Metric | Target | Action if Low |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Overall Conversion Rate | Industry benchmark | Optimize worst step |
| Step Completion Rate | >70% | Investigate UX issues |
| Time Between Steps | Reasonable for action | Reduce friction |

### Identifying Bottlenecks

1. Look for steps with completion rate <50%
2. Compare to expected behavior:
   - Is the step too complex?
   - Is there a technical issue?
   - Is the value proposition clear?

### Common Bottleneck Causes

| Step | Common Issues |
|------|---------------|
| Add to Cart → Checkout | Price shock, shipping costs |
| Checkout → Payment | Payment method issues, trust |
| Form View → Submit | Too many fields, unclear CTA |
| Landing → Signup | Weak value proposition |

## Filtering

### Global Filters

Apply global filters to segment funnel analysis:

**Example segments:**
- Mobile users only
- Traffic from Google Ads
- Spanish visitors
- First-time visitors

### Comparing Segments

1. Apply segment filter (e.g., Mobile)
2. Note funnel metrics
3. Remove filter, apply different segment (e.g., Desktop)
4. Compare drop-off rates per step

### Date Range

Funnel respects the selected date range:
- Users must complete steps within the date range
- Useful for campaign-specific analysis
- Compare different time periods

## Use Cases

### Checkout Optimization

1. Select checkout funnel
2. Identify step with highest drop-off
3. Common findings:
   - Cart → Checkout: Add guest checkout
   - Checkout → Payment: Add payment methods
   - Payment → Confirmation: Improve trust signals

### Lead Form Analysis

1. Create funnel: Page View → Form Start → Field 1 → ... → Submit
2. Identify where users abandon
3. Optimize:
   - Reduce required fields
   - Improve field labels
   - Add progress indicator

### Mobile vs Desktop Comparison

1. Filter by Mobile
2. Note overall conversion rate
3. Filter by Desktop
4. Compare:
   - If Mobile significantly lower, prioritize mobile UX
   - Identify which step has biggest gap

### Campaign Effectiveness

1. Filter by campaign UTMs
2. Analyze funnel progression
3. Compare campaigns:
   - Same funnel entry, different completion?
   - Traffic quality varies by campaign

### A/B Test Validation

1. Define same funnel for test and control
2. Filter by test variant (via UTM or custom property)
3. Compare funnel metrics
4. Statistical significance if sample size adequate

## Funnel Configuration

## Best Practices

### Funnel Design

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep steps sequential | Skip logical steps |
| Use 3-6 steps | Create 10+ step funnels |
| Name steps clearly | Use technical names |
| Match real user journey | Create artificial paths |

### Step Granularity

- Too few steps: Miss where drop-off occurs
- Too many steps: Overwhelming, hard to act on
- Right balance: 4-6 steps for most funnels

### Multiple Funnels

Create separate funnels for:
- Different user journeys (new vs returning)
- Different products/services
- Different entry points
