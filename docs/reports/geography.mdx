|--------|-------------------|
| Entrances | Where your audience is located |
| Bounce Rate | Content relevance by region |
| Conv. Rate | Market fit by country |
| Revenue | Highest-value markets |

### Identifying Patterns

Look for:
- **High traffic, low conversion**: May need localization
- **Low traffic, high conversion**: Expansion opportunity
- **High bounce rate**: Content or language mismatch
- **Revenue concentration**: Market dependency risk

## Use Cases

### Identifying Top Markets

1. Sort table by **Entrances** (descending)
2. Note top 5-10 countries
3. Compare with business priorities
4. Check Conv. Rate for each

### Finding Expansion Opportunities

1. Sort by **Conv. Rate** (descending)
2. Filter: Entrances greater than 50 (statistically significant)
3. Look for countries with:
   - High conversion rate
   - Low current volume
   - Business expansion potential

### Detecting Localization Needs

1. Sort by **Bounce Rate** (descending)
2. Filter: Entrances greater than 100
3. High bounce + high traffic suggests:
   - Language barriers
   - Cultural mismatch
   - Payment method issues
   - Shipping concerns
