# What is gtm-msr.appspot.com and How to Prevent It from Triggering Tags in GTM

When working with Google Tag Manager (GTM), you may notice traffic coming from **gtm-msr.appspot.com**.  
This domain is **owned by Google** and appears in very specific scenarios.

---

## What is gtm-msr.appspot.com?

This domain appears when:

- You (or your team) enter **Preview Mode** in Google Tag Manager  
- Google runs **automated scans** or internal container checks  
- A **browser extension** or tool triggers a render for debugging  
- GTM loads your container inside an **Appspot sandbox environment**

⚠️ **Important:**  
This traffic **is NOT from real users** — but it *can* cause your tags to fire, which leads to:

- Fake pageviews  
- Phantom conversions  
- Polluted campaign attribution  
- Incorrect ROAS calculations  

---

## Why This Domain Is a Problem

If tags fire when GTM loads from `gtm-msr.appspot.com`, you may experience:

- ❌ Inflated events  
- ❌ Artificial conversions in Meta Ads / Google Ads / TikTok  
- ❌ Incorrect GTM trigger debugging  
- ❌ Polluted analytics reports  

This is especially harmful for:
- Conversion tracking  
- Ads optimization signals  
- GTM-based event measurement

## How to Prevent Tags From Firing on gtm-msr.appspot.com

You can fully block this domain at the trigger level by using a simple variable.

---

## Step 1 — Create a Blocking Variable in GTM

1. Go to **Variables**  
2. Click **New → Custom JavaScript Variable**  
3. Name it: `IsNotGTMAppspot`  
4. Use this code:

```js
function() {
  return location.hostname !== "gtm-msr.appspot.com";
}

Save

This variable will return true only when the page is not GTM’s sandbox domain.

## Step 2 - Add the condition in all triggers

For every trigger that launches tags (pageviews, clicks, conversions, etc.):
	1.	Open the trigger
	2.	Add this condition:

IsNotGTMAppspot  equals  true

This ensures:

Tags fire everywhere except inside GTM’s Appspot preview environment.

## How to test it
	1.	Click Preview in Google Tag Manager
	2.	Confirm the debug URL becomes:

    ```
    https://gtm-msr.appspot.com/...
    ```

    3.	Check the tag panel → No tags should fire

If everything looks correct:

✔ Publish your container
✔ Your tags are now protected from false firing
