# How Sealmetrics Calculates SEO Traffic

Sealmetrics is designed to classify traffic sources with precision while maintaining strict privacy compliance.  
This document explains how SEO (organic search) traffic is detected and how we avoid misclassifying paid Google Ads traffic.

## 1. SEO Traffic Definition

Sealmetrics attributes a visit to **SEO traffic** when the following two conditions are true:

### ✅ **Condition 1: The referrer is Google**

Recognized Google domains include:

- google.com  
- google.\<country\> (e.g., google.es, google.fr, google.de)  
- googleusercontent.com  
- googleapis.com  

Any hit from a Google domain *may* be considered SEO traffic.

### ❌ **Condition 2: No advertising parameters are present**

If the landing URL contains **any** of the following parameters, it is *not* SEO traffic:

- `gclid` (Google Ads auto-tagging)
- `gad`
- `gbraid`
- `wbraid`
- Newly introduced Google Ads identifiers
- Any `utm_` parameter (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, etc.)

### 🟦 **If BOTH conditions are met → Sealmetrics classifies the hit as SEO traffic**

Example:
````
Referrer: https://google.com/search?q=analytics+tools
Landing URL: https://yoursite.com/pricing
Parameters: none
Result: SEO Traffic
````

## 2. Avoiding Confusion with Google Ads Traffic

A common question:  
**“Could Google Ads traffic ever be classified as SEO traffic?”**

### ✔️ Sealmetrics keeps this risk extremely low — under 1%.  
For misclassification to happen, TWO things must occur simultaneously:

1. The referrer must be Google  
2. The landing URL must contain *no* advertising identifiers:

   - No `gclid`
   - No `gad`, `gbraid`, or `wbraid`
   - No `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, etc.
   - No value-track parameters from templates

### Why this is rare:

- Google Ads **auto-tagging almost always adds `gclid`**  
- Manual UTM tagging is standard practice  
- Google continuously introduces new ad identifiers, all of which Sealmetrics detects  

### Result:  
If **any** ad-related parameter exists → Sealmetrics classifies the hit as **Paid Traffic**, not SEO.

## 3. Summary Table

| Condition | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Referrer is Google AND no ad/UTM parameters | **SEO Traffic** |
| Referrer is Google AND ad/UTM parameters are present | **Paid Traffic** |
| Referrer is not Google | Classified based on platform (Referrer, Social, Direct, etc.) |
