# How to Change UTM Parameters in Sealmetrics

Some businesses use custom UTM structures or alternative analytics platforms such as Adobe Analytics, Piwik PRO, or proprietary BI systems.  
If you prefer not to follow the defaults used by Google Analytics and want to adapt Sealmetrics to your own UTM naming conventions, you can fully customize them inside the platform.

This guide explains how to update your UTM reference parameters in just a few steps.

## 1. Access the UTM Reference Settings

Navigate to:

**Account Setup → UTMs Reference**

From this panel, Sealmetrics shows the current UTM parameters your account recognizes.  
The default values follow standard GA4 conventions, but all fields are customizable.

## 2. Update the UTM Parameter Names

Inside the **UTMs Reference** section, you can modify each parameter to match the naming structure you want to work with.

Available fields include:

- `utm_source`
- `utm_medium`
- `utm_campaign`
- `utm_term`
- `utm_content`
- `utm_matchtype`
- `utm_network`
- Additional optional custom fields depending on your setup

Each field has a **Restore** option to revert back to Sealmetrics’ default UTM naming if needed.

After updating any UTM field, click **Update** to save the changes.

## Why Customize UTMs?

Customizing UTM parameters is especially helpful when:

- Migrating from GA4 and aligning Sealmetrics with existing conventions  
- Using Adobe Analytics or another platform with a different parameter structure  
- Maintaining internal naming conventions for campaign management  
- Shortening long UTMs (e.g., `utm_campaign` → `cmp`)  
- Standardizing UTMs across teams and tools

Sealmetrics will automatically track whichever parameter names you define here.

## Important Notes

- Changes apply **from the moment you update the settings**.  
  Previous hits collected before the update will not be renamed retroactively.

- If a UTM parameter is missing in the URL, Sealmetrics will display **"(not set)"** for that field.

- Keep your UTM structure consistent across all campaigns to maintain clean and accurate reports.
