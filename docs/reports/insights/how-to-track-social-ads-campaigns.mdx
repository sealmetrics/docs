# How to Track Social Ads Campaigns

Sealmetrics can track traffic from Meta Ads — including Facebook and Instagram — **without cookies**, using only privacy-safe parameters.  
The key requirement: **UTM parameters** must be added to your ad URLs.  
Without UTMs, Sealmetrics cannot reliably distinguish paid vs. unpaid traffic coming from Meta domains.

## Why UTMs Matter for Meta Ads Tracking

Meta traffic often arrives with minimal referrer information.  
If UTMs are *not* added:

❌ Paid and organic Meta traffic blend together  
❌ Campaign-level reporting disappears  
❌ You cannot analyze ad set or creative performance  

If UTMs *are* added:

✔ Full campaign attribution  
✔ Clear performance insights  
✔ Correct paid vs. organic classification  
✔ No cookies required

### Use UTM Parameters
UTM parameters are tags added to your ad URLs that Sealmetrics can read instantly — no identifiers, no session tracking.

#### How to implement UTMs
1. Add UTM parameters to all destination URLs  
2. Follow consistent naming conventions  
3. Include all relevant UTM fields
