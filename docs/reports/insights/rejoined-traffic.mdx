# What is Rejoined Traffic?

These visits have resumed browsing on your website after more than **6 hours of inactivity**.

Instead of counting this traffic as a new session and assigning it to **Direct traffic**, as GA4 and other tools typically do—creating chaos in Direct Traffic—Sealmetrics labels it as **"rejoined traffic."**

This reflects traffic originating from any source, which has been reactivated after a period of pause or inactivity.

---

## How Other Platforms Handle Returning Users

Most analytics tools, including Google Analytics 4 (GA4), classify returning users after session timeouts as:

- **Direct Traffic** — even when users originally came from SEO, social media, or paid ads  
- **New Sessions** — creating artificial session breaks  
- **Lost Attribution** — original traffic source becomes invisible  

---

## The “Direct Traffic Chaos” Problem

Traditional analytics creates major issues:

### **1. Inflated Direct Traffic Numbers**
- SEO visitors returning hours later get classified as "Direct"
- Paid campaign visitors appear as "Direct"
- Social traffic gets mixed into "Direct"

### **2. Attribution Confusion**
- Marketers lose visibility on the true source
- Campaign ROI becomes unreliable
- Channel performance gets distorted

### **3. Decision-Making Challenges**
- Budget misallocation
- Wrong assumptions about brand awareness
- Incomplete understanding of customer journeys

## Sealmetrics' Solution: Rejoined Traffic Classification

### **How Rejoined Traffic Works**

When a user returns after **6+ hours**, Sealmetrics:

- Recognizes the pattern  
- Preserves context  
- Classifies it as **Rejoined Traffic**  
- Avoids inflating Direct Traffic  

---

## Why the 6-Hour Threshold?

It balances:

- Practical user behavior  
- Work breaks or daily routines  
- Multi-visit research and buying cycles  

Examples of 6+ hour gaps:

- Morning research, evening purchase  
- Workday browsing → after-hours return  
- Weekend discovery → weekday follow-up  
- Multi-day consideration for high-value items
