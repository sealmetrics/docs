# Understanding the “(not set)” Value in Sealmetrics Reports

The value **“(not set)”** appears in Sealmetrics whenever a UTM parameter expected for attribution is **missing** from the URL. This happens when **one or more UTM parameters are present**, but another required one is not.

Sealmetrics does **not infer or guess missing UTMs** — if a parameter doesn’t exist in the URL, its value is recorded as **(not set)**.

---

## Why “(not set)” Appears

When Sealmetrics processes UTM parameters, it reads exactly what is present.  
If the URL contains some UTMs but not all, the missing ones become **(not set)**.

### Example URL
````
domain.com?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=no-cookies&utm_term=kw1
````
Parameters found:

- `utm_source = google`
- `utm_campaign = sincookies`
- `utm_term = kw1`

Parameter **missing**:

- `utm_medium = (not set)`

Because `utm_medium` does not exist in the URL, Sealmetrics assigns **(not set)**.

---

## Common Scenarios Where “(not set)” Appears

### 1. Missing UTM Medium  
If `utm_source` exists, but `utm_medium` is missing:
````
utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=winter_sale
````
Result:

- **Source:** facebook  
- **Medium:** (not set)

---

### 2. Missing UTM Source  
If `utm_medium` exists but `utm_source` is missing:
````
utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=promo
`````
Result:

- **Medium:** cpc  
- **Source:** (not set)

---

### 3. Incorrectly Formatted URLs  
Examples of issues that cause missing values:

- Incorrect separators (`;&` instead of `&`)
- Using uppercase UTMs (`UTM_Source`…)
- Missing `utm_` prefix (`source=google`)
- Double `?` in the URL
- Spaces or unencoded characters

If a parameter is malformed, Sealmetrics treats it as **not included**, resulting in **(not set)**.

---

## Why Sealmetrics Never "Fills in the Blanks"

Unlike some analytics tools:

❌ No guessing missing UTMs  
❌ No automatic inference  
❌ No cross-hit reconstruction  

Sealmetrics maintains:

✔ Privacy-first measurement  
✔ Strict attribution rules  
✔ Complete transparency  

If a UTM is missing → its value is **(not set)**.  
This ensures your data is always accurate and compliant.

---

## How to Avoid “(not set)” Values

### 1. Always Use Full UTM Sets

Minimum recommended:
````
utm_source=
utm_medium=
utm_campaign=
````
### 2. Use UTM Templates or Builders

This reduces human errors and helps ensure consistency.

### 3. Keep Naming Conventions Consistent

- Use lowercase  
- Replace spaces with `_` or `-`
- Keep naming short but descriptive  
- Document your team’s UTM rules  

### 4. Check Final URLs After Redirects

Some redirect chains strip UTMs → leading to missing values.

## Summary

“**(not set)**” in Sealmetrics means a required UTM parameter is **missing from the URL**.  
Because Sealmetrics follows a privacy-first, no-assumptions approach:

- It only uses explicitly provided data  
- It never reconstructs or guesses missing parameters  
- It ensures full transparency and compliance  

If you see many “(not set)” values, review your UTM structure and ensure campaign URLs contain all parameters needed for accurate attribution.
