# Why Do I See More Conversions or Revenue in Sealmetrics Than in My ERP?

It’s common to see more conversions or revenue in Sealmetrics than in your ERP system.  
Here’s why — and how to fix it.

## Sealmetrics Counts Exactly What Fires

Sealmetrics uses a **strict and transparent conversion pixel**:

> **If the pixel fires, we count it. If it doesn’t fire, we don’t.**

Sealmetrics does **not**:
- Deduplicate conversions  
- Validate orders on the backend  
- Match data with your ERP  
- Identify unique users  

We only record the **event**, as triggered by your website.

---

## Why Discrepancies Happen

### 1. Duplicate Pixel Fires  
If the confirmation page reloads, the pixel fires again.

Examples:  
- User refreshes the thank-you page  
- User clicks the confirmation link from their email  
- User returns via browser history  

Each load = a new conversion.

---

### 2. Users Revisit the Confirmation Page

If a visitor bookmarks the confirmation page or returns to it later, the pixel fires again.

This results in:
- Multiple conversions from the same order  
- Inflated revenue if the pixel includes value parameters  

---

### 3. Pixel Placed on the Wrong URL(s)

If the conversion pixel is placed on:
- Multiple pages  
- Cached pages  
- Intermediary confirmation steps  

…it may fire unintentionally.

This is one of the most common causes of overcounting.

---

### 4. No Server-Side Validation

Your ERP validates:
- Payment success  
- Order status  
- Customer details  

Sealmetrics does **not** perform backend checks.

If someone loads the confirmation page but payment fails, Sealmetrics counts the event — your ERP does not.

---

## How to Fix These Issues

### ✔ 1. Place the Pixel Only on the Final Thank-You Page  
Avoid:
- Cached pages  
- Pages that users may revisit  

Ensure the page is:
- Unique  
- Non-cacheable  
- Only reachable after successful payment  

---

### ✔ 2. Add Server-Side Conditions  
Example condition logic:

> Fire the pixel ONLY if the order is confirmed.

This prevents:
- Fake conversions  
- Reloaded conversions  
- Pre-payment hits  

---

### ✔ 3. Fire the Pixel Only Once Per Session  
Your developers can enforce session-based logic to avoid double counting.

Example safeguards:
- Fire only once per `order_id`  
- Prevent firing on page refresh  
- Block pixel firing if the same user reloads the page  

---

## Summary

Sealmetrics shows **exactly what fires**.  
Nothing more, nothing less.

If your ERP shows fewer conversions, the explanation is simple:

> The conversion pixel is firing more often than it should.

By tightening pixel placement and adding safeguards, you can align metrics between Sealmetrics and your backend systems.
