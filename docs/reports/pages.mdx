# Pages

The Pages report analyzes page-level performance, showing which pages receive the most traffic and how they perform.

## Accessing the Report

2. Click **Pages** in the sidebar

**URL pattern:** `/sites/{site_id}/pages`

## Tabs

The report has two tabs with different perspectives:

### All Pages Tab

Shows all pages that received traffic during the selected period.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Page** | URL path and page title |
| **Trend** | 7-day sparkline showing recent traffic pattern |
| **Pageviews** | Total views (with relative progress bar) |
| **Unique Visitors** | Distinct visitors (with relative progress bar) |
| **Content Group** | Assigned content group (if configured) |

### Landing Pages Tab

Shows pages where sessions started (entry points to your site).

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Page** | URL path and page title |

| Yellow | 40-70% | Average |

## Top Pages Chart

Horizontal bar chart showing the 10 most visited pages.

- Bars represent pageview count
- Hover for exact values
- URLs truncated if too long

## Content Groups

Content groups categorize pages for aggregated analysis.

### What Are Content Groups?

Instead of analyzing individual URLs, group related pages:

| Group | Example Pages |
|-------|---------------|
| Blog | /blog/*, /articles/* |
| Products | /products/*, /shop/* |
| Checkout | /cart, /checkout/* |
| Account | /account/*, /profile/* |

### Filtering by Content Group

1. Click the content group filter above the table
2. Select one or more groups
3. Table shows only pages in selected groups

### Configuring Content Groups

Content groups are configured in Settings → Properties.

See [Content Grouping](../implementation/content-site-structure/content-grouping) for setup instructions.

## Filtering

### Table Filter Builder

Click the filter icon to open the filter builder:

**Available fields:**
- Path (URL path)
