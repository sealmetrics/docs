# Properties Report

The Properties report lets you analyze custom properties attached to conversions and microconversions, broken down by traffic source (UTM parameters).

## What This Report Shows

When you track conversions with custom properties (like `product_category`, `plan_type`, or `payment_method`), this report helps you understand:

- Which property values perform best across different traffic sources
- How conversions distribute across property values by campaign
- Which traffic sources drive specific property outcomes

## Accessing the Report

1. Select a site from the site selector
2. Click **Properties** in the sidebar

## Report Interface

### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **View Mode** | Toggle between Totals (absolute numbers) and Rates (percentages) |
| **Data Source** | Filter by All Events, Conversions Only, or Microconversions Only |
| **Property Key** | Select which property to analyze (e.g., `currency`, `plan_type`) |
| **Export** | Download the current view as CSV |

### Property Analysis Table

The main table shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source / Medium / Campaign** | UTM attribution for this row |
| **Total** | Sum of all events for this UTM combination |
| **[Property Values]** | Dynamic columns for each unique value of the selected property |

### Heatmap Visualization

Cells are color-coded to highlight performance:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Green** | Above average share for this property value |
| **Yellow** | Average share |
| **Red** | Below average share for this property value |

This helps you quickly identify which traffic sources over- or under-perform for specific property values.

### View Modes

**Totals Mode**
- Shows absolute counts for each property value
- Useful for understanding volume distribution

**Rates Mode**
- Shows conversion rates (events / entrances)
- Displays entrance count for context
- Useful for comparing efficiency across sources

## Available Properties Table

Below the main analysis, you'll find a summary of all available property keys:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Property Key** | The property name (click to analyze) |
| **Conversions** | Count from conversion events |
| **Microconversions** | Count from microconversion events |
| **Total** | Combined count |

## Example Use Cases

### E-commerce: Product Category Analysis

Track which traffic sources drive purchases in each category:

```javascript
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', 99.99, {
  product_category: 'electronics',
  brand: 'Apple',
  payment_method: 'credit_card'
});
```

Then analyze the `product_category` property to see:
- Google Ads drives 60% of electronics purchases
- Facebook drives 45% of fashion purchases
- Organic search has the highest conversion rate for accessories

### SaaS: Plan Type Analysis

Understand which campaigns drive premium vs basic subscriptions:

```javascript
sealmetrics.conv('subscription', 49.00, {
  plan_type: 'premium',
  billing_cycle: 'annual'
});
```

Analyze `plan_type` to optimize campaigns for higher-value plans.

### Lead Gen: Lead Source Analysis

Track which forms and sources generate leads:

```javascript
sealmetrics.conv('lead', 0, {
  form_name: 'contact',
  lead_source: 'pricing_page'
});
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Consistent Property Names

Standardize property names across your implementation:

```javascript
// Good - consistent naming
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', value, { product_category: 'shoes' });

// Avoid - inconsistent
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', value, { category: 'shoes' });
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', value, { productCategory: 'shoes' });
```

### 2. Keep Property Values Clean

Use consistent, lowercase values:

```javascript
// Good
{ plan_type: 'premium' }

// Avoid
{ plan_type: 'Premium' }
{ plan_type: 'PREMIUM' }
```

### 3. Limit Property Cardinality

Properties work best with a manageable number of unique values (under 50). Avoid using unique IDs as property values.

### 4. Track Meaningful Properties

Focus on properties that inform business decisions:

**Good properties:**
- `product_category` - Informs inventory and marketing decisions
- `plan_type` - Helps optimize pricing campaigns
- `payment_method` - Identifies payment preferences by source

**Less useful properties:**
- `order_id` - Too many unique values
- `timestamp` - Already tracked automatically
- `user_email` - Privacy concern, too granular

## Requirements

The Properties report requires:

1. **Conversions or microconversions with properties** - Events must include custom properties
2. **Traffic with UTM parameters** - At least some traffic should have UTM attribution

If no properties are found, the report will display: "No properties found. Properties are set when tracking conversions and microconversions."
