# Backup Codes

Backup codes are one-time use codes that let you access your account when you can't use your authenticator app.

## What Are Backup Codes?

Backup codes are:
- 10 unique codes generated when you enable 2FA
- Each code can only be used once
- Your safety net when your phone is lost, broken, or unavailable
- Independent of your authenticator app

## When to Use Backup Codes

Use a backup code when:
- Your phone is lost or stolen
- Your phone is dead and you can't charge it
- You're traveling without your usual device
- Your authenticator app was deleted
- You got a new phone and forgot to transfer 2FA

## Viewing Your Backup Codes

1. Go to **Settings → Security**
2. Under **Two-Factor Authentication**, click **View Backup Codes**
3. Enter your current 2FA code to confirm identity

```

## Storing Backup Codes Safely

### Good Storage Options

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Password manager | Encrypted, accessible | Single point of failure |
| Physical printout in safe | Offline, secure | Can be lost/destroyed |
| Encrypted USB drive | Portable, secure | Can be lost |
| Bank safe deposit box | Very secure | Inconvenient access |

### Storage Best Practices

1. **Never store in plaintext** on your computer
2. **Keep separate** from your password
3. **Store in multiple locations** (e.g., password manager + printed backup)
4. **Don't take photos** on your phone (could sync to cloud)
5. **Label clearly** so you know what they're for

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Email codes to yourself
- ❌ Store in notes app without encryption
- ❌ Keep only one copy
- ❌ Store in same place as password
- ❌ Share with others

## Code Format

Backup codes follow this format:

```
xxxxx-yyyyy

Where:
  x = lowercase letter or number
  y = lowercase letter or number

Example: abc12-def34
```

Codes are case-insensitive (abc12-def34 = ABC12-DEF34).

## Running Low on Codes

### Warning at 3 Remaining

When you have 3 or fewer codes left:

```
⚠️ Low Backup Codes Warning

You only have 3 backup codes remaining.

We recommend regenerating your codes to
ensure you always have access to your account.

```

### Warning at Login

If you sign in with a backup code and few remain:

```
⚠️ Only 2 backup codes remaining

You should regenerate your codes soon to
avoid losing access to your account.
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Backup Code" Error

1. Check for typos (especially 0 vs O, 1 vs l)
2. Ensure you haven't already used this code
3. Verify codes haven't been regenerated since you saved them
4. Try a different code

### All Codes Used

If you've used all 10 codes:
- You must have access to your authenticator to generate new codes
- If you can't access your authenticator, contact support

### Lost All Codes and Authenticator

Contact support for account recovery:

1. Email security@sealmetrics.com
2. Subject: "2FA Account Recovery"
3. Include:
   - Your account email
   - Proof of identity
   - Recent account activity you remember
