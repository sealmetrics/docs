# IP Allowlist

IP allowlisting restricts access to your Sealmetrics account to specific IP addresses, adding another layer of security beyond passwords and 2FA.

## What Is IP Allowlisting?

When enabled, only users connecting from approved IP addresses can access your account. Requests from other IPs are blocked, even with valid credentials.

```
User Request
     ↓
Check IP Address
     ↓
┌──────────────────┐
│ IP in allowlist? │
└────────┬─────────┘
         │
    Yes ↙   ↘ No
   Allow    Block
```

## Who Should Use It?

IP allowlisting is ideal for:

- **Organizations with static IPs** (office networks)
- **High-security environments** (financial, healthcare)
- **Compliance requirements** (SOC 2, PCI-DSS)
- **Restricting vendor/contractor access**

Not recommended if:
- Team works from many locations
- No VPN infrastructure
- Frequently changing IPs

### Step 2: Add IP Addresses

Add IPs before enabling:

```
Configure IP Allowlist
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your current IP: 192.168.1.50
[Add Current IP]

Allowed IP Addresses:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ (No IPs added yet)                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Add IP Address:
[                                         ]

```

### Step 3: Enable Allowlist

After adding IPs:

```
IP Allowlist Configuration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Allowed IP Addresses:

Office Branch:     192.168.2.0/24
```

### VPN Endpoints

```
# VPN exit IPs
VPN Server 1:      203.0.113.10
VPN Server 2:      203.0.113.11
VPN Range:         203.0.113.0/28

## Bypass Options

### Emergency Access

If you're locked out:

1. Contact support at security@sealmetrics.com
2. Verify identity (photo ID required)
3. Support can temporarily disable allowlist
4. You add your new IP
5. Re-enable allowlist

### Admin Override (Growth)

Designated admins can bypass the allowlist:

```
Allowlist Bypass
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

☑ Allow designated admins to bypass IP allowlist

Bypass requires:
☑ 2FA verification
☑ Additional email confirmation
☑ Logged in audit trail

Admins with bypass:
+ admin@company.com
+ cto@company.com
[+ Add Admin]

⚠️ Bypass should only be used in emergencies.
All bypass events are logged.
```

## What Happens When Blocked

When someone tries to access from a non-allowed IP:

```
Access Blocked
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your IP address (198.51.100.99) is not in
the allowlist for this account.

If you believe this is an error, contact
your account administrator.

Your IP: 198.51.100.99
Time: January 15, 2024 14:32:15 UTC

[Request Access]
```

### Request Access Workflow

Users can request access:

```
Request IP Access
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your IP: 198.51.100.99

Reason for access:
[Working from home due to office closure  ]

Duration needed:
○ One-time access
● Temporary (until [February 1, 2024])
○ Permanent

[Submit Request]

Request will be sent to account admins.
```

Admins receive notification:

```

IP: 198.51.100.99
Reason: Working from home due to office closure
Duration: Until February 1, 2024

Location (approximate): Seattle, WA, USA

[Approve] [Deny]
```

## Audit Logging

All IP allowlist actions are logged:

```

## Best Practices

### Do

- ✅ Add your current IP before enabling
- ✅ Include VPN exit IPs
- ✅ Use CIDR ranges for dynamic office IPs
- ✅ Document each IP's purpose
- ✅ Review allowlist quarterly
- ✅ Test access from allowed IPs

### Don't

- ❌ Enable without adding any IPs (locks everyone out)
- ❌ Add overly broad ranges (defeats purpose)
- ❌ Forget to add backup admin IP
- ❌ Leave expired temporary IPs

## Troubleshooting

### "Locked myself out"

1. Try from another allowed location (office, VPN)
2. Ask a colleague with access to add your IP
3. Contact support with identity verification

### "IP keeps changing"

If your ISP assigns dynamic IPs:
- Use VPN with static exit IP
- Request static IP from ISP
- Use CIDR range (less secure but workable)

### "Can't access from VPN"

1. Check VPN exit IP (not internal VPN IP)
2. Use `curl ifconfig.me` to find exit IP
3. Add that IP to allowlist
