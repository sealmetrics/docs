# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security beyond your password, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Why Enable 2FA?

Even with a strong password, your account can be compromised through:
- Password reuse from other breached sites
- Phishing attacks
- Keyloggers or malware
- Shoulder surfing

With 2FA enabled, attackers need both your password AND physical access to your authenticator device.

## Supported Methods

### TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)

Sealmetrics uses TOTP, the industry standard for 2FA:

- 6-digit codes that change every 30 seconds
- Works offline (no SMS needed)
- Compatible with all major authenticator apps

### Compatible Apps

| App | Platform | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Google Authenticator | iOS, Android | Simple, widely used |
| Authy | iOS, Android, Desktop | Cloud backup, multi-device |
| 1Password | All platforms | Integrated with password manager |
| Microsoft Authenticator | iOS, Android | Good for Microsoft ecosystems |
| Bitwarden | All platforms | Open source |

## Enabling 2FA

### Step 1: Access Security Settings

1. Click your profile icon in the top right
2. Select **Settings → Security**
3. Find **Two-Factor Authentication**

### Step 2: Start Setup

```

## 2FA for Teams

### Requiring 2FA (Growth Plan)

Admins can enforce 2FA for all team members:

```
Security Policy
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

☑ Require 2FA for all users

Users without 2FA:
  • mike@company.com (invited to set up)
  • guest@agency.com (invited to set up)

Grace period: [7] days

After grace period, users without 2FA
will be unable to access the account.
```

### Monitoring 2FA Adoption

```
Team Security Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2FA Enabled: 4 of 5 users (80%)

User                    2FA Status    Last Login
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
admin@company.com       ✅ Enabled    Today
sarah@company.com       ✅ Enabled    Today
mike@company.com        ⚠️ Pending    Yesterday
john@company.com        ✅ Enabled    3 days ago
guest@agency.com        ❌ Not set    1 week ago
```

## Security Best Practices

### Do

- ✅ Use a reputable authenticator app
- ✅ Save backup codes in a secure location (password manager, safe)
- ✅ Keep backup codes separate from your password
- ✅ Regenerate codes after using some

### Don't

- ❌ Store backup codes in plaintext on your computer
- ❌ Share your authenticator with others
- ❌ Screenshot your QR code
- ❌ Disable 2FA without good reason

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Code" Error

1. Check your device time is accurate (TOTP is time-based)
2. Ensure you're entering code for Sealmetrics (not another service)
3. Wait for new code (codes change every 30 seconds)
4. Try using a backup code

### Authenticator Shows Wrong Time

TOTP requires accurate time:

**iPhone:** Settings → General → Date & Time → Set Automatically

**Android:** Settings → Date & Time → Automatic date & time

### Syncing Issues with Authy

1. Open Authy settings
2. Tap "Sync" to refresh
3. Try code again
