# How Sealmetrics Protects User Privacy

At **Sealmetrics**, privacy is not a regulation to comply with — it’s a core philosophy.  
Our platform is designed to protect users’ data beyond legal requirements.

## Core Privacy Principles

1. **Privacy Over Profit**  
   No tracking if it compromises user privacy.  

2. **No Individual Tracking**  
   No user profiles or personal identifiers — only aggregated behavior.  

3. **Data Minimization**  
   Collect only what’s necessary for meaningful analytics.
