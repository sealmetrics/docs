# Super-Privacy Mode & How “Isolated Hits” Work

Super-Privacy mode — also known as **Isolated Hits mode** — is Sealmetrics’ highest level of privacy protection. It is designed for organizations that require strict anonymity, such as healthcare, government, finance, or any environment where identifying users is not an option.

This measurement mode guarantees **complete unlinkability** between all interactions.

## What Makes Super-Privacy Mode Unique?

Super-Privacy mode ensures **maximum anonymity** by applying three core principles:

### ✅ 1. No User Identifiers  
Sealmetrics does **not** use:

- Cookies  
- Session IDs  
- Fingerprinting  
- Local storage  
- Browser identifiers  
- IP-based identifiers  
- User IDs of any kind  

Nothing can be used to recognize or re-identify a person.

### ✅ 2. A Simple Pixel Implementation  
You install a lightweight pixel on your website.  
That’s all—no configuration required.

### ✅ 3. Every Hit Is Fully Isolated  
Each page view is treated as an **independent, standalone event**.

There is absolutely **no correlation** between:

- Multiple page views  
- Consecutive clicks  
- Returning visits  
- User behavior patterns  

This makes re-identification **technically impossible**.

## What Sealmetrics Can Know in Super-Privacy Mode

Even with maximum anonymity, Sealmetrics still provides powerful aggregated analytics.

### Example Scenario  
Fifty users visit your website.

### Sealmetrics will know:

### 🔵 1. **Total Entrances**  
If 50 hits come from external referrers →  
➡️ Sealmetrics knows there were **50 entries**.

### 🟣 2. **Total Page Views**  
All page views are counted in aggregate.

### 🟢 3. **Total Conversions**  
Conversions are also aggregated with no user linking.

### 🟡 4. **Attribution by Source / Medium / Campaign**  
Thanks to **Source-ID attribution**, Sealmetrics can identify:

- How much traffic each channel brought  
- How many conversions each source generated  
- How many hits belong to each campaign  
- Which referrers are driving results  

All of this is done **without tracking people**, only isolated hits.

## What Sealmetrics Cannot Know (By Design)

To preserve strict privacy:

❌ No user paths  
❌ No user journeys  
❌ No session reconstruction  
❌ No returning visitor identification  
❌ No cross-hit correlation  

It is **technically impossible** to determine whether two hits came from the same person.

## Why Use Super-Privacy Mode?

Super-Privacy mode is ideal for:

- Organizations with strict legal requirements  
- Sensitive industries (healthcare, government, legal, finance)  
- Websites needing guaranteed anonymity  
- Companies seeking maximum privacy and compliance  
- Teams that value ethical analytics

## Summary

Super-Privacy Mode provides:

- **Maximum privacy protection**  
- **No user tracking whatsoever**  
- **Isolated, anonymous hits only**  
- **Accurate aggregated analytics**  
- **Campaign attribution without user IDs**  
- **Full compliance with GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, PECR**

It is the **purest form of privacy-first analytics**, designed for organizations that cannot compromise on data protection.
