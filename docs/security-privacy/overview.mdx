# Security & Privacy

Sealmetrics was built from the ground up with one core principle: **privacy is not a feature, it's the foundation**. Every architectural decision, every line of code, every system design choice prioritizes user privacy and data security.

## Privacy by Design

### What We Don't Collect (Ever)

Sealmetrics is built on what we **don't** track:

- **No IP addresses** - Not collected, not stored, not processed at any layer
- **No cookies** - Zero cookies, zero local storage, zero fingerprinting
- **No persistent identifiers** - No user IDs, device IDs, or tracking tokens
- **No personal information** - No emails, names, phone numbers, addresses
- **No user journeys** - Cannot reconstruct individual browsing patterns across sessions
- **No behavioral profiles** - Cannot build personality or preference models
- **No cross-site tracking** - Only measures your website, never follows users elsewhere
- **No sensitive data** - No health information, financial data, political views, religious beliefs

This isn't a marketing claim. It's architecturally impossible for Sealmetrics to identify individual users.

### The Four-Variable System

Every interaction on your website is captured using exactly four data points:

1. **Timestamp** - When the event occurred
2. **User Agent** - Browser and device type (parsed but never stored)
3. **Current URL** - The page being viewed
4. **Referral URL** - Where the visitor came from

That's the complete data set. Nothing more is collected. Nothing more is stored.

### How Anonymization Works

**At Collection:**
- User agent strings are immediately parsed for browser/device insights
- The raw user agent is discarded and never stored
- No fingerprinting algorithms are applied
- No attempt is made to create persistent identifiers

**At Processing:**
- Each event is processed in isolation
- No correlation with other events from the same user
- Statistical aggregation only
- Individual-level data is never accessible

**At Storage:**
- Only aggregate patterns are stored
- No way to reverse-engineer individual users
- No raw user-level data persists anywhere in the system

## Legal Compliance by Design

### GDPR Compliance (No Consent Required)

Sealmetrics operates under Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR: **Legitimate Interest**.

**Why no consent is required:**
- We don't collect personal data as defined by GDPR
- No IP addresses = no personal identifiers
- Anonymous aggregate data only
- No possibility of individual identification
- Processing is strictly necessary for analytics purposes
- Minimal data collection approach

**Data retention:** Up to 25 months without requiring user consent.

**Your rights as a data controller:**
- No GDPR compliance burden from using Sealmetrics
- No need to update privacy policies for personal data processing
- No Data Processing Agreement (DPA) required
- No risk of GDPR violations from analytics

### ePrivacy Directive Compliance (No Cookies = No Consent)

The ePrivacy Directive (Cookie Law) requires consent for cookies and terminal storage.

**Sealmetrics compliance:**
- Zero cookies used
- No local storage access
- No code stored on user devices
- No fingerprinting techniques
- No session reconstruction across visits

**Result:** No consent banner required. No data loss from cookie rejection.

### CCPA Compliance

The California Consumer Privacy Act regulates "personal information."

**Sealmetrics compliance:**
- No personal information collected as defined by CCPA
- No sale of data (we don't have data to sell)
- No third-party sharing
- Anonymous analytics only

**User rights:** Because we don't collect personal information, CCPA disclosure and deletion requirements don't apply.

### PECR Compliance (UK Cookie Law)

The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations apply in the UK.

**Sealmetrics compliance:**
- No cookies or similar technologies
- No information stored on user devices
- No access to device information beyond standard HTTP headers
- Fully compliant without consent requirements

## Data Security Measures

### Infrastructure Security

**Geographic isolation:**
- All servers located in Dublin, Ireland (EU)
- No international data transfers
- EU data protection laws apply
- No exposure to weaker privacy jurisdictions

**Encryption:**
- **In transit:** HTTPS/TLS encryption for all data transmission
- **At rest:** Full encryption of stored data
- End-to-end encryption throughout the entire system

**Access controls:**
- Strict role-based access controls
- Granular permissions system
- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative access

**Audit trails:**
- Complete logging of all system access
- Operational activity monitoring
- Security event tracking
- Compliance audit support

### Operational Security

**Infrastructure redundancy:**
- Multiple backup systems
- Automatic failover capabilities
- Geographic distribution within EU
- 99.9% uptime SLA

**Security monitoring:**
- 24/7 system monitoring
- Intrusion detection systems
- Automated threat response
- Regular vulnerability scanning

**Incident response:**
- Established incident response procedures
- Security breach protocols
- Rapid response capabilities
- Transparent communication commitments

**Regular audits:**
- Ongoing security assessments
- Third-party security audits
- Penetration testing
- Code security reviews

### Application Security

**Bot filtering:**
- Sophisticated bot detection algorithms
- Filters search engine crawlers (Googlebot, Bingbot)
- Removes monitoring tools and scrapers
- Blocks datacenter traffic
- Protects data quality and system resources

**Data validation:**
- Input sanitization on all endpoints
- Protection against injection attacks
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- DDoS protection

**Secure API access:**
- Bearer token authentication
- Token expiration policies
- Secure token storage requirements
- HTTPS-only API endpoints

## Privacy Transparency

### What We Track (The Complete List)

**Page views:**
- URL visited
- Timestamp of visit
- Referring URL
- Browser type (derived from user agent)
- Device type (derived from user agent)
- Operating system (derived from user agent)
- Country (derived from time zone, not IP)
- Screen size category
- Language preference

**Events:**
- Event name (e.g., "Purchase", "Signup")
- Event timestamp
- Associated page URL
- Optional revenue value
- Optional custom properties (you define these)

**Sessions (GlobalTracker mode only):**
- Temporary session ID (expires when browser closes)
- Session start time
- Pages viewed in that session only
- Session duration

**Nothing else.** This is the exhaustive list.

### What We Can't Do (Technical Limitations)

Because of our privacy-first architecture, Sealmetrics **cannot:**

- Identify individual users across sessions
- Rebuild complete user journeys over time
- Track users across different websites
- Create behavioral profiles
- Correlate visits from the same person
- Identify returning visitors (across sessions)
- Determine demographic information
- Infer sensitive personal attributes
- Share data with third parties (we don't have data to share)
- Sell user data (legally impossible—no user data exists)

These aren't policy choices. They're architectural constraints. The system is fundamentally incapable of these actions.

## Why Ad Blockers Don't Block Sealmetrics

Ad blockers target tools that:
- Build user profiles
- Track users across websites
- Serve advertisements
- Implement behavioral targeting
- Use known tracking domains

**Sealmetrics doesn't do any of these things:**
- First-party analytics only (measures your site, not users across sites)
- No user profiling
- No advertisements
- No behavioral targeting
- Unique domain (app.sealmetrics.com)
- Doesn't match ad blocker filter patterns

**Result:** Your analytics work for 100% of visitors, even those using privacy tools.

## Privacy Philosophy

### Our Commitment

We believe website owners deserve accurate analytics. We also believe internet users deserve privacy. These goals are not in conflict.

**Our principles:**
1. **Privacy is non-negotiable** - We will never compromise user privacy for features
2. **Transparency is mandatory** - We fully disclose what we collect and how it works
3. **Compliance is inherent** - Privacy compliance is built in, not bolted on
4. **Security is foundational** - Data security is a system-wide priority
5. **Users come first** - When in doubt, we choose the more private approach

### Independent Verification

Don't take our word for it:

- **Open documentation** - Our four-variable system is fully documented
- **Transparent jurisdiction** - European company under strict EU privacy law
- **Public architecture** - No hidden tracking mechanisms
- **Legal compliance** - Independently verified GDPR compliance
- **Source code transparency** - Tracking script is inspectable
