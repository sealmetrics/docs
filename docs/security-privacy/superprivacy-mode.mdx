# How SuperPrivacy Tracking Works

SealMetrics focuses on key information to generate valuable reports for marketers, aiding in decision-making.

The data points we consider include:

- **Common user agent**
- **Timestamp**
- **URL**
- **Referral URL**

SealMetrics tracks **hits** rather than individual journeys or paths, ensuring compliance with the **ePrivacy Directive**.
For example, if 25 people are on your site, SealMetrics tracks how visitors navigate your site — but only in an **aggregated** and **anonymous** way.

---

## Tracking Setup

SealMetrics works with a small **JavaScript snippet** embedded into your website.

### Installation

Add this script to all pages of your website:

```html
<script src="https://t.sealmetrics.com/t.js?id=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID" defer></script>
```

That's it. Pageviews are tracked automatically.

## Tracking Events

### Conversions

Track goal completions with monetary value:

```javascript
// Purchase with revenue
sealmetrics.conv('purchase', 99.99, {
  order_id: 'ORD-12345',
  currency: 'EUR'
});

// Lead (no monetary value)
sealmetrics.conv('lead', 0, {
  form_name: 'contact'
});
```

### Microconversions

Track user interactions and funnel steps:

```javascript
// Add to cart
sealmetrics.micro('add_to_cart', {
  product_id: 'SKU-123',
  product_name: 'Blue Shoes'
});

// Video play
sealmetrics.micro('video_play', {
  video_id: 'demo-2025'
});
```

## Real-Time Tracking

Once the tracker is implemented, SealMetrics starts tracking in real-time:

- Every page view is counted in aggregate form
- No individual journeys are recorded
- Only hits are measured, preserving privacy
