# What We Track vs What We Don’t

Sealmetrics is built on one foundational principle:

> **If tracking a metric could compromise user privacy, we do not track it — even if regulations allow it.**

This document details everything Sealmetrics *does* and *does not* track, why, and how this enables full GDPR/ePrivacy compliance without requiring user consent.

# What We DO Track  
## The Four-Variable System (Isolated Hits)

Sealmetrics processes each page view (“hit”) independently using **only four non-identifying data points**:

### 1. Timestamp  
- **Purpose:** time-based analysis and trend insights  
- **Privacy:** cannot identify an individual  

### 2. User Agent (Not Stored)  
- **Used for:** browser/device category detection  
- **Not stored:** complete user agent strings are discarded  
- **Result:** anonymous device classification  

### 3. Current URL  
- Page path  
- Page popularity  
- Anonymous content performance  

### 4. Referral URL  
- Anonymous attribution  
- Campaign performance  
- Traffic source identification

# How We Decide What to Track

Before tracking any metric, we evaluate:

- **Privacy Risk:** Could this identify someone?  
- **Business Need:** Is this essential?  
- **Legal Compliance:** GDPR, ePrivacy, CCPA, PECR  
- **Future Proofing:** Will it remain compliant?  
- **User Expectation:** Would users expect this?  

Sealmetrics always chooses the **more restrictive option**.
